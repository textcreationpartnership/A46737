         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:32247:4"/>be assimilated to Christs five loaves, wherewith were fed as you well know, five thousand men, beside women and Children, <hi>Matth. 14.21.</hi> For what think ye, Honoured Sirs, I pray you of these five things:

            <p>Will they not serve as well to feed the Souls of those thousands of Men, Women and Children, which (as I suppose) are in, and near your City, as those five loaves the bodies of those five thousand Men, besides Women and Children? Will not they please them as well? Will not they fill them as well? and will there not be enough thereof left, when they are all filled for many, many thousands more, as after the filling of so many thousands, there were left and taken up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full, <hi>vers. 20.</hi> to fill many more?</p>
            <p>Worthy Sirs, My Soul longs to do
<pb facs="tcp:32247:5"/>good to your Souls, and if by this Tract I may fulfil my desire, and thereby make you so wise to Salvation, as to labour with all your might after the enjoying of those five pleasant things, which I but now compared to those five miraculous loaves, wherewith Christ satiated so many thousands, for your soules delight; I care not though I my self be censured for pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and be counted as <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>2 Cor. 11.16, 17.</hi> a fool for my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; my labour being but small, but your gain and comfort then exceeding great; for then it will be with you, as it was with the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when they lived in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and every one did sit under his Vine and under his Fig-tree, as the Lord had promised it, <hi>Mich. 4.4.</hi> both

<pb facs="tcp:32247:6"/>sweetest Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, who is our Shadow, our Vine, our Fig-tree, our Apple-tree, our Tree of Life, <hi>Cant. 2.3. Isa. 25.4▪ John 15.1.

<pb facs="tcp:32247:7"/>to be in the same <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> where the Angels sweetest Musick is, and where that sweetest Tree of Life, Christ corporally is, and where fulness of joy is, and where pleasures are for evermore, <hi>Psal. 16.11.</hi> though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you are, as it were, in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, this world, wherein you are now sojourners, being but, as it were, a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren wilderness, wherein no water, that is the water of Life, is, it being only to be found in the <hi>New Canaan,</hi> which is here in part, and in the heavenly at full for ever.</p>
            <p>O Sirs! How is it with you, when you hear me speak of these things? Is it not with you now as it was with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> blessed <hi>Austins</hi> Mother? who when she heard her Son most sweetly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb facs="tcp:32247:7"/>of the joyes of Heaven, cried out and said, <hi>Evolemus; Quid facio hic?</hi> Let us flee hence; What do I here?

            <p>But I am loath to detain you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer here upon the Borders of that goodly Land; I would to God, you were all in it, and that I

            <p n="1">1. As Nature is taken in man, in regard of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As Nature is taken in him, as it is divided from and against Action.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That though we speak so of a Natural Delight, as distinct from a Supernatural, we do not deny a Preternatural, or Unnatural, as is in those, who take delight in eating of Ashes, Coals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A Supernatural or Spiritual, which is a motion in the Soul of man, following the understanding, as apprehending a Spiritual and Supernatural good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it and in it.</p>
            <p>Where Note again, That whereas some make a Question of it, whether Delight may be in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that it is here

            <p>For proof whereof I use this Argument.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Great</hi> [Delight.] Where Note again, that there is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Delectatio Minor,</hi> Or a lesser Delight, which

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Delectatio Major,</hi> Or, a greater Delight in the Creator, as here in Christ, who is God blessed for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With great Delight.</hi> Marke, Great was the Spouses here, and great is every gracious souls delight in Christ; for great are his enjoyments, and great enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have their great resentments: Such a soul being for the present, as it were separated from the Body, elevated to Heaven, saturated with the food of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, consolated with the Waters of Life, inebriated <hi>with joy unspeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>Whence now (to defer a little the handling of the two parts of my Text) do flow these three following Observations, like so many Rivers of Chrystal.</p>
            <p>The first Crystaline River or <hi>Observation</hi> hence streaming is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those Souls which are most happily desponsated unto Christ, have their sweet Experiences of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gracious Souls, or Souls espoused to Christ, do and will, and we also must sometimes sit down under the shadow of Christ's sweetest Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Delight which a Saint doth, and we also may take in Christ, is exceeding great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the first, I shall for its Illustration, resolve these four <hi>Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What Experiences, and especially such Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:32247:14"/> 2. <hi>How such Experiences differ from speculative knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In what Faculty of the Soul they consist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Why such have such Experiences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the first, I Answer, They are openings, as the word sheweth; for Experience is, as Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and Criticks tell us, from the ancient word <hi>per<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o,</hi> which signifies <hi>aperio,</hi> I open, because Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do open things to us, as plainly as any thing can; especially, such Experiences as are spoken of here, opening unto us plainly, perspicuously, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, the mind and good will of God in Christ to our Souls, and causing them to see, as in a glass, his pleased and appeased face, thorow the Riches of his Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.30.</p>
            <p>Or thus, Experience, say

                  <hi>Isaac Ambrose, in the Believers Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</note> some, is a Knowledge and Discovery of something by sence, not evident in it self, but manifested by some event or effect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the second, I Answer, That they differ thus:</p>
            <p>Speculative Knowledge is of Universals, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences are Cognitions of
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Videatur Suarez. Disp.</hi> 1. <hi>De Nat. Met. Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> singulars. As here for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Those gracious Christians which are happily espoused to Christ, can tell singularly, and as it were by signs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32247:14"/>and tokens, and sence, how such and such a time it was with them, when Christ embraced their souls, when their souls were for the present, as it were in Heaven, when Heaven did center in them, when in them was joy and jocundity, not to be uttered by them, when Mercy did sing, Love smile, and Grace it self did grace and crown their longing desires with long and lasting comfort, streaming from the Throne of Grace, and the God of all Comfort.</p>
            <p>To the third, I Answer, That it consists not so much in the apprehensive, as in the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Experientia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie in judicio consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. Suarez. Met.

            <p n="4">4. To the fourth, I answer, That it must needs be so,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because they have often tryed him: For many be the times when with mighty and strong cryes and tears they did make their requests to him; this morning and that morning they were up before day, and when they were up, up were their prayers with them, wrestling with God to the break of the day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. nor would they give him over till to them he had made over the Assurance of his love, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32247:15"/>a recompence of theirs; and this got them their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because they are wont to be very familiar with him: For seldom, or never, are they absent from him; if they are at home, they are with him, if from home they are with him; and when they are with him, how boldly, how familiarly, how intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they talke with him! like the Spouse in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Luther,</hi> of whom

            <p n="3">3. Because else, what sound and grounded knowledge would they have? Where Note, That there is a two-fold Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Knowledge in the Schooles called <hi>Quid,</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32247:15"/>generated by Experience is most clear, because it gathereth things from effects, and such and such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. So I know wine by its taste, Christ's being in me by his mighty working, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.29.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>second,</hi> that it comes by Experience, I will make out and shew by this Demonstration: I know that I shall be saved, because I find by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that I love the Brethren; so the Apostle, <hi>We know that we have past from death to life, because we love the Brethren,</hi> 1 John 3.14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Else, how can they deal as men ought, with their subtile and craftie enemies? You know what the Captain of them all is called, namely, an old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9.

Now let us draw water, I mean, matter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32247:16"/>of Application from this first christalline river, which floweth from the first part of my Text. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To begin with a Use of Trial. If any of us would know whether his soul be espoused to Christ, let him look for experiences. Beloved, What expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences have ye? Have ye had any familiar acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him? Can you say and stand to it that you have seen God, as it were, face to face, when you sought his Face? as <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.30. Have ye, when ye prayed to the Lord, to deliver you from your Enemies, been heard in that thing? as <hi>David, Psa.</hi> 18.6, 48. Is Christ wont to visit your souls? as <hi>Can.</hi> 5.1. and according to <hi>John</hi> 14.18. Do you know what his visits mean? Can you tell how he cometh and goeth, I mean, how he cometh when he visits, and goeth when he leaves, in the case of desertions, as <hi>Can.</hi> 5.6. Have ye felt the joyes of Heaven as those have, who are predestinated to Heaven? we have a Notable place for this, <hi>Can.</hi> 2.16. <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the Lillies;</hi> that is, he feeds and fills me with his comforts which are like Lillies, refreshing, reviving, cooling. See also, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let this serve for Counsel. Thus,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be thus, then to be assured that we are Christs espoused Saints, let us labour for experiences, following these directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Searching our memories for things done for us by him.</hi> For it is a principle among the learned,

We have notable expressions for this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.6. <hi>I communed with my own heart, my spirit made dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent search.</hi> There is searching, which here I require; and then, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. <hi>I will remember the works of the Lord; surely I will remember thy works of old.</hi> There is remembring, and this remembring is three or four times mentioned, <hi>vers.</hi> 3, 6, 11. according to the fore-mentioned Principle, that a manifold recorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same thing or things, begets experience, as here, of the works (Mark, works, in the Plural) of the Lord, and of his wonders of old; namely, wonders of Mercy, shewed in old time. Now, as <hi>David</hi> did, so say you then, every one of you that is espoused to Christ, and so will I by the grace of God; search and remember the works of the Lord, and his wonders which he hath done of old, or of late, in and for my soul. See also, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.21. <hi>This I recall to mind, therefore I have hope.</hi> See also, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.5. <hi>I remember the dayes of old.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By a Mortified Life,</hi> and what is that? You are dead, saith the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. and then what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? <hi>Your Life is hid with Christ in God;</hi> as if he should say,
<note n="*" place="margin">Gagneius in Loc.</note> saith one, Though now ye are righteous, I add, and though the world do not know your glory, and what you are in God, yet such is your advancement, as that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know what a blessed and blisful life you live with Christ in God, being dead to sin, for the sake of God. For, thus it is; The Kingdom of God is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32247:17"/>in us, and it is Righteousness, and Peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. That is hid from the eyes of the world, but not from Gods, nor ours. For in God we live, when to sin we are dead, and that our souls know; <hi>Mortifie therefore your earthly Members,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. and so say I, to wit, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry.</hi> Oh Christians! what is the reason, think ye, that ye have little Experience of Christs love? is it not because you do not live a mortified life? You are too lusty, too lively, too jovial, too proud, too high-minded, too worldly, too passionate, too fierce, too heady, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3, 4. for such Experiences. You Drunkards especially cannot taste how sweet Christ is, because your strong liquor is so sweet to you, and you Usurers cannot tell by experience, namely, what Christ's unsearchable riches are, because you are all for this worlds corruptible riches; and you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and filthy livers, and wanton Dames, who are so for unclean touches, looks, embraces, dances, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, cannot speak one word of Christs embraces, kisses, visits, because of your unchast carriages, cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. and unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bidings our by night, and unwarrantable Visits. But, if you would once <hi>Sampson</hi>-like, kill the Lion, which is in your way, that such Experiences cannot come away, and fall for your share also, I mean, your Lyon-like corruptions, your pride of life, your lusts of the eye, your lusts of the flesh, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32247:18"/>your covetous practises, your passionate fits, your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness, your gluttony, your drunkenness, your strife, and envying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. it would not be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you also, like <hi>Sampson,</hi> would find sweet honey, even in the dead Lyon; that is, in the Mortification of your most lively sins; sweet experiences, I mean of Christs love, usually following a mortified life; and therefore I pray you do so, and the Lord help you in the doing it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By a godly life.</hi> A godly life, is the way to life; and a man is never more truly merry, than when he is truly godly, that is, when he spends his time with God; for then, oh the Consolations! Oh the delectations which then do flow from God! Beloved, could we but see the inside of a man that fears and serves God; oh what joyes! Oh what gladness should we there see! as sent from God. <hi>For there is joy, and gladness, in the habitations of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Psal. 118.15. Understand within, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. But outwardly, there is commonly but little of it to be seen; and as for the fulness of it, that they shall meet with after death, when they shall be no more seen. And therefore who is there amongst this people, that would see good dayes, and have such experiences, let him have a care to serve God, let him spend his time with God, let him try God but one day so, and he will be able to say, by his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as <hi>David</hi> by his, <hi>One day in thy Courts, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a thousand,</hi> Psal. 84.10. But hereof I shall have an occasion to speak more fully, when I shall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32247:18"/>pass over into the land of Delight.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>By Wrestling with him.</hi> For did not <hi>Jacob</hi> see God even face to face, and what a wrestler was he? <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24, 25, 26, 30. Did not he just then get his greatest Experience when he sought God with all his diligence? Did not God shew his very face <hi>to him,</hi> when he was with so much earnestness and grace intreated <hi>by him?</hi> There is nothing therefore to be lost, by earnest praying: Earnest praying open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heaven, shaketh the earth; and overcometh God, who made heaven and earth. O <hi>earth, earth; Hear,</hi> therefore, <hi>the word of the Lord,</hi> and wrestle with the Lord of the whole <hi>earth,</hi> and never let him go. When once you have begun, pray to him with all your might, till you have seen his face to your hearts delight, and can say, as <hi>Jacob</hi> said, <hi>I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved,</hi> Gen. 32.30. Beloved, the Lord lookes for it that we should so wrestle with him; and none, I think, did ever set himself to this great and mighty work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but sped by it indeed; the Lord giving him a glance, and glimps of his love, because he will not have it said, that any man in vain doth seek his love. I for my part, look upon this, as the chiefest and choicest way, that will lead and bring you into the land of Experience, and I would not miss it, for all the wealth which is in the wide worlds circumference For a man shall never try it, if he try it in earnest as he ought, but he shall see somewhat of God, and get some experience of the unexpressible love of Christ,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32247:19"/>when he shall set himself so to wrestle with Christ; Christ will then answer him in plain tearms, hear I am, when he seeth that he will not be denyed upon any tearms. And therefore, O dear Souls, try this way and Christ will meet you half way. Nay, it may be, when as ye are coming on to try this wrestling, ye are off yet a great way, as once the Prodigal was, when he was coming towards his Father, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.20. Oh this wrestling, what a mighty thing therefore it is, for to gain Experience! Beloved, I know you pray most of you, but I fear you do not wrestle, and therefore want experience; therefore wrestle. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it self alone will not do it, and yet I know that every wrestling is prayer too; but every prayer is not wrestling, that is by many, many degrees beyond it, and will do your business in the matter of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. I may say of it, from my poor experience, as <hi>David</hi> once of the Sword of <hi>Goliah, There is none like it: give it me,</hi> 1 Sam. 21.9. So, there is no means like it, whereby a man may gain experience: give it me.</p>
            <p>Must I use any Incentives? then consider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That else you cannot be truly wise, as you must be, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.16. for who be the wisest Lawyers, Physitians, Souldiers, but the most experienced? which caused one <hi>Tassus,</hi> being asked what is the wisest thing? to answer, Experience. Answerably whereunto, I also should answer you, if you should ask me, Who is the wisest Christian? the most Experienced.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:32247:19"/> 2. That without such Experiences, you can have no assurance of Christs special favour; for, as though a man receive many favours of a great man, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he assure himself of his special favour, unlesse he have some special experience of it: So, unlesse I can experimentally speak of some special tokens of Gods love, I cannot be certain of his special love; though many be the common

Zanchi de Nat Det. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> Mercies with which he crowns me and others; for, do not I know, that he causeth his Sun to shine upon the just and unjust? <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. Labour therefore for Experiences, to be sure of his special love.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That else you cannot speak successefully to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, unlesse you know what you speak by proof, as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 32.8. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Eudamias</hi> having heard a Philosopher say, that onely a wise man would make a good Captain, said, It was a good speech, but he that spake it was not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, because he was never a Souldier himself. Semblably whereunto, I also say to you, that none will believe you, as not being to be credited when you speak well, if you do not speak from Experience; and therefore be for Experiences, I mean those sweet experiences of Christs dealing with you, which I spake of formerly.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:32247:20"/> 2. If we are Christs espoused Saints, then let us make use of our Experiences, for such have their sweet Experiences. Experiences are like flowers; for as they recroate us with their colour, refocilate us with their odour, revive us with their savour; so do Experiences refresh us with their calour, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us with their vigour, restore us with their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and therefore let us use them, and that in two Cases especially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In Desertions;</hi> When we cannot see God, when God and we are become strangers, when strangers insult over us, when over us and in us, sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sorrow fulness bear dominion, then Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of God. goodnesse and of his former graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings with us, will do us good in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion. And therefore let us say then, as <hi>David</hi> once, <hi>Lord, thou has been favourable to thy Land; thou hast brought back the Caprivity of Jacob, thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin, Selah.</hi> So, Lord, thou hast been favourable to us in former times, thou hast turned our Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when sin led us captives, thou hast taken away all our iniquities and covered all our sins, <hi>Selah.</hi> And then say, moreover, thou hast taken away all thy wrath, thou hast turned thy self from the fierceness of thine anger, and then, <hi>Turn us, O God, of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and cause thine anger towards us to cease.</hi> Psal. 85.1, 2, 3, 4. Nay, read the whole Psalm, and make, use of it in this case, it is worth your Reading.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>So in Oppositions;</hi> When enemies rise against
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32247:20"/>us, and Devils roar, when both combine to vex us sore, when their taunts be up, their sarcasms up, their reproaches up, when they devise their devises against us, when with their tongues they smite us, when all the day long, and in secret, they trucidate and slay us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. being wrathfully displeased at us; then former Experiences will do much good to us, when comfortably we can remember this, that time was, when their hatred was as great as now, and yet they could not harm us, because Christ did love us; and therefore let us not be afraid not dismayed, but rather let us seasonably reflect &amp; look back upon times past, when our enemies would ride over our back, but could not, because God suffered it not, but kept them back, because his love fails not. A notable place for it, we have in <hi>Isa.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6. <hi>Thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy, in his distress; a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat; when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall, &amp;c.</hi> Read the rest. Oh how sweet is such an experiment, in such a case! Oh, it holds up your heads, cheareth up your hearts, sustentates and bears up your hopes; therefore to experience, to experience let us go as to a Mistress, to teach us in all our miseries, assuring our selves, that he who hath hitherto been all along for us, and loved us, will still love us, and never leave us, but still favour us, and never fail us, defend us, and not deliver us as a prey to those that hate us; his holy Name be blessed and praised by us, now, and for ever.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:32247:21"/>
            <p> I come now to make my Vessel, I should say, my mind, to swim in that second River of Chrystal, which issueth from the main Sea of my Text: It runs thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gracious Souls, or souls espoused to Christ, do and will, and we also must sometimes sit down under the shadow of his sweetest Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may add his Merit, if you will, as I informed you formerly, and peruse for a further Confirmation hereof, <hi>Isa.</hi> 25.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. Where give me leave to tell you, that I am now, and shall be upon as comfortable a point, as possibly I could have <hi>chosen</hi> for Gods <hi>chosen.</hi> For I do even most ardently desire to conveigh the warmest blood, that ever heated the heart of Christ, the sweetest Merits that ever were heard of, the primest balm that ever dropt from the pens of the holy pen-men of Gods blessed Spirit, upon the sacred leaves of the Book of Life; the dearest Mercies that ever rolled together, the relenting bowels of Christs tenderest compassions into their (for sin) broken and tender hearts; and I pray God heartily to bless my labours to them graciously.</p>
            <p>For the better managing of this sweet Lesson I shall do three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Shew, What Christ sweetest Mercy is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Why gracious Souls do, and will, and must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so sit down under the shadow thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>And then apply it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the First, <hi>What Christ's Mercy is.</hi> It is, I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32247:21"/>say, the fairest flower in his Garland of Majesty,

            <p n="2">2. To the Second I answer, that it is, and will, and must be so, for these two Causes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because else they cannot stand. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying, I must needs sit, for I am weary, I can stand no longer; and if the party saying so, be in the field, it will (you know) sit under the shadow of a tree, especially if the Sun shine hot: and so saith a gracious soul, I must needs sit, and sit down under the shadow of my Saviours mercy, for I can stand no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger else, especially when it is in the field, militating with Sathan, and grapling with the wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, which burnes, when it is once kindled, as fervently as the Sun, nay more; and so sits down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary, under that most refreshing shadow of Christs sweetest mercy. We have these following no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table places for it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.9. <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</hi> Here he grapples with Gods wrath, and then runs to the shadow of his mercy, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12. Where he calles to mind his ancient mercies. So, <hi>Psal.</hi> 85 5. <hi>Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:32247:22"/>here again he luctateth with the Almighties wrath; and then fleeth to the shadow of his mercy, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>Shew us thy mercie.</hi> Now when I speak of God, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so mean Christ, who also is God, <hi>John</hi> 1.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because Christ hath promised them his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing mercy, which is a prime property that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a shadow, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all you that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest;</hi> or, as some read the word, will refo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillate and retresh you. Never was any poor labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er so refreshed by any creature, never was any poor traveller so refocillated by any shadow, as poor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, travelling, sinful, sin-sick souls are by Jesus Christ, when they flee <hi>to him</hi> to be refreshed <hi>by him,</hi> by vertue of this precious promise; for it is as much as if Christ should say therein to poor wearied, tired souls, I will turn your depth of sorrow into seas of comfort, your bitter tears into sweetest cordials, your sad dejections into glorious triumphs, your hels of horror, into heavens of joy; and fill your pensive minds with unutterable lightsomeness, your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with peace, which passeth all understanding; your now grieved spirits with the incomparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of my blessed and holy Spirit, and your hearts with delights not to be equalled with any here; and with pleasures hereafter, which <hi>never, never</hi> shall be taken from you, but shall last for evermore. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>John</hi> 16.22. This, this makes gracious souls so bold, as to sit down under the shadow of Christ's sweetest mercy, for rest, comfort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32247:22"/>because they have such a sure promise from Christs own mouth to assure them of it. I could give you more Reasons for this blessed Truth, but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to reserve some-what for Incentives, which also may serve for Reasons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My next work is to cause this River of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal, now to run into your hearts, by the help of a suitable Application. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I shall apply it by putting you upon a Tryal; as thus; Is it thus, that gracious, or to Christ espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Souls, do, and will so sit under the shadow of Christs sweetest Mercies? Then let us see, whether ever we so sate down under the shadow of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and so obtained Mercy: If we would know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our souls be such gracious souls, or souls espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Christ, which we may know by these following Signatures.</p>
            <p>If we have obtained Mercy, then our case is like <hi>Israels,</hi> or the Churches of God in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when God shewed it his Love; for his Love and Mercy are parallels, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13, 15. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As God circumcised his People, and cut their Navel, which before was not cut, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4. so are those which have obtained Mercy circumcised, namely in their hearts, with the circumcision made without hands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. that is, the fore-skin of sin, which is in the heart, and hath been predominate in their lives is cut away, and they are come away, as they are bid, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.10. Whereas, those which have not obtained Mercy, have their fore-skins still
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32247:23"/>upon, and in their very eyes, having eyes full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. and more especially upon their hearts, having hearts exercised with covetous practises, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. as Usury, and the like, and running after covetousness, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. and full of pride, fornication, and malice, envy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. and of vile, filthy, and evil thoughts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. Hatred, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. and of hypocrisie, both gross and close, and by name that above many other kinds of it, which Divines call sturdy hypocrisie; which I rather mention because many are guilty of it, and know it not, it carrying them out so far and so high, as that it will not only make them do many things like that young man, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.20. but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to suffer as the Hypocritical <hi>Jewes</hi> have suffered Persecution these fifteen hundred years, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being banished from their own Country, and hardly used in almost all Countries for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As Gods People then were washed with water, and thorowly washed from their blood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. so are, and so have those who have obtained mercy, been washed from all their sins in Christs blood; <hi>For he loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</hi> saith St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1.5. And how shall we know that? By that which followeth, <hi>and made us Kings and Priests to God, vers.</hi> 6. Mark, Priests, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering our selves, and all manner of spiritual sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.11. and Kings, bearing rule over our eyes, appetites, tongues, hands,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32247:23"/>feet, and bringing in subjection our own bodies, and the whole body of sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. whereas others who never obtained mercy, though they be never so pure in their own eyes, yet were never washed from their silthiness, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. Nor can be made to offer and give up themselves wholly to God, nor to bear that rule which the Saints bear over their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral members, eyes, tongues, hands, feet, nor to bring the whole body of sin-into subjection; being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry slaves of lust and uncleanness, and the servants of lust and corruption, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As that people were annointed with Oyl. <hi>vers.</hi> 9. so are gracious souls with the Holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. whereas, others are without the Spirit, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. being wholly flesh, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. that is, altogether carnal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As that people were adorned with Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Bracelets, a Chain, Jewels, and the like, <hi>vers.</hi> 10, 11, 12. So are those which have obtained Mercy, graced with such like Ornaments, for they are graced with Christs Obedience and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. wherewith they are covered as with Badgers skins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. and with all manner of saving graces, and with a new heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. and with good works, which are the Jewels, the Bracelets, the Chain, the Silks, the Silver, the Gold, wherewith they are adorned of God; for they are full of Mercy, and Almes, and good Works, as <hi>Dorcas, Act.</hi> 9.36. and out of Christs fulness they have all received grace for grace,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32247:24"/>
               <hi>John</hi> 1.16. In short, as soon as the grace of God, which bringeth salvation, <hi>appeared to them, Tit.</hi> 2.11. that grace also which brings the assurance of their desponsation, <hi>appeared in them;</hi> and those good works which we so press upon others, came even pressing in upon them, to make them rich indeed, rich in gracious deeds, rich in good works, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18. Whereas those which have not obtained Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, want both Christs Merits and Righteousness, which they are ignorant of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. and also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteousness, together with all the saving graces of God's Spirit; because they have not the Spirit, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. the Spirit, I mean, of grace, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. Common gists they may have, nay some of them have good store; as for Example, the gift of Prayer, but the grace of Prayer they have not, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. So a faculty to Mouth they may have, but the grace of Weeping they have not, as you may see in the same place. And a natural, conjugal, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental Love they may have, but the grace of Love shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. and where by we love that which we see not, to wit, the souls of others, as we love God, whom we see not, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.17. they have not.</p>
            <p>Again, Reprobate they are to every good work, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. So as they either omit every good work, or some especially, as works of Justice, whereby we give God and every man his due, in that they make no conscience of wronging their brethren, by false
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32247:24"/>weights, measures, mixing of wares, and all manner of oppression, and loving and shewing of mercy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.8. in that they either do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or visit, or instruct their brethren at all, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, visit, and instruct them without Mercy, that is, without being toucht with a fellow-feeling of their miseries, contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>Now try and see what manner of men and women you be, for you may as well know, that you sate down under the shadow of Christ mercy, if you did, as a man that fate down under another tree, may know that he did; for loe, as it is said of <hi>Saul,</hi> that after he was annointed by <hi>Samuel, God gave him another heart, and all those signs which Samuel had told him of, came to pass that day,</hi> 1 Sam 10.9. So after men have been annointed with the Spirit, and have sate down first under the shadow of Christs mercy, they receive another heart, and become men of another spirit, and all those signes which I spake of but now do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choatively come to passe, the selfe-same day; and therefore this self-same day examine your selves in order by them, and the Lord help you in the doing of it; for how can you live so as some of you do, not knowing, and so doubting, whether you have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy, yea, or no? O put this great thing out of doubt this day by such a trial.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I shall apply this Truth, putting my self upon <hi>a Ʋse of Addubitation;</hi> then, what shall I think of those men and women, who think <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their souls are espoused to Christ; and yet never <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e down under
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32247:25"/>the shadow of that mercy which cometh by Christ? who will be reputed to be gracious, and yet never tasted of those refreshments which come by his sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and are so exceeding glorious; who can tell how sweet their meat, and their drink is, but not how sweet Christ is, who exceedeth both; who solace themselves in the multitude of their worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and regard not these superlative and super-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding enjoyments; whose heaven is in this life, whose life is living in pleasure, whose pleasure is in sin, whose sin was never relinquished, and whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved natures were never vanquished. Shall I say that they are gracious, God forbid, unless I will also say that Devils are gracious; for what are they but Devils incarnate? So they will rave some of them, and so they will roar, and so they will lye, and so they will blaspheme, and tare, and so they will hate, and so they will retain their old wicked, crooked natures, and such enemies they be, some of them to all good works, and so void of grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I shall apply this point by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> thus; <hi>Must we sit down under the shadow of Christs mercy sometimes? Then let us do so in the Name of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here two Questions will come to be raised and resolved.</p>
            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>Which be those times?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. 2. <hi>How must we sit down under the shadow of Christs Mercy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the first Question, <hi>Which be those times?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:32247:25"/>
            <p> I Answer thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> When we are wheeling about to Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in the beginning of our conversion, when Christ is sent to turn us from our iniquities, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26. then it is a fit time to turn about to him, and to send forth cries, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. and teares for mercy, to the God of Mercy, as the poor Publican did, saying, <hi>God be merciful to me a sinner,</hi> Luk. 18.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When afterwards in our prayers, we plead for relief, for pardons, for answer, and none comes; when the <hi>Word</hi> never answers us <hi>one word, Matth.</hi> 15.23. When we know not what to <hi>do,</hi> we fearing that we shall <hi>die,</hi> die, namely for ever; because Conscience accuseth, the Law threateneth, Hell Fire appeareth, and we are like to be consumed, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. unlesse our sins can be condoned and we justified; then is that also a fit time for us to cry aloud, in that self-same time, as the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> cryed once, saying, <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David, Matth.</hi> 15.22. and so to betake our selves, to the shadow of his Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When we are outwardly afflicted, when chastenings imbitter our cherishings, when like good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wheat we are thresht upon with great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous crosses, when like precious gold we are tried by fire, when fire and fiery trials do scorch us, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and afflictions assault us, troubles and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions perplex us; then this shadow of Christs Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will be seasonable for us, because that is a time of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32247:26"/>need with us, by reason of such fiery trials, which are to try us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When you are threatened by your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and cruel enemies, when enemies have their combinations, when their combinations are backt with subtile and slie inventions, when inventions go for truth, when truth is like to suffer; a shade of Christs mercy will be more worth to us, than this worlds Signiory, that time being a time of need and misery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When God and we are for the present separated, when we cannot see his face, when his face is as it were wrapt up, and he will not look towards us, because he is not well-pleased with us; which how often it is so with us, who knoweth not, being a man of some Experience among us. I for my part can speak it from my sad Experience, that it is almost daily so with me; and that therefore, as <hi>Bernard</hi> spake it long before me, my daily &amp; almost only and continued cry after Christ is this, <hi>Revertere, reverte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> return, return, <hi>and be thou like a Roe upon the mountains of Bether.</hi> (<hi>Cant.</hi> 2.17.) or <hi>Division,</hi> for <hi>Bether</hi> signifieth <hi>Division;</hi> and what is such a deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but a division, dividing Christ and us one from another. But hereof more hereafter upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When Satan for some certain grievous falls, troubleth us sore, saying, that though the armes of Christ, and gates of Grace stand wide open, for enterance, and embracement, until the Sun of Grace
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32247:26"/>be set, yet in this case the case is altered; nor is there any room left for our supportation, because we have out-stood the day of visitation, and because the period of his gracious day which hath so long lasted, is now expired; that though the blood of that unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lamb, upon repentance and remorse, saved even them that spilt it, yet will it not save us, because we have afresh, as it were, and without remorse spilt it; that though the promises of Life in the Word of Truth, be made unto poor sinners without stint, limitation, and exception of sins (that against the Holy Ghost only excepted) yet we have no part in them, because our names are not written in the Lambs Book of Life (which was my sad case once) then a shade of Christs grace will be seasonable for us, because of that burning heat, which then we feel within us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> When we have walked with God, as <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.9. when God and we have spent much time together; when together with him, and his Son, we had sweet Communion, when that sweet Communion was the end of our walking; when walking hath made us fit and apt for sitting, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be some-what weary, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. then sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and sitting under the shadow of Christs Mercy, will be very comfortable for us, and desirable to us; as when we have walked with a dear friend many houres, we desire to sit down at last, as being almost tired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> When by a piercing Sermon we have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32247:27"/>been toucht to the quick for sin, when sin plaguing us stares in our faces, when our faces begin to be filled with shame, when shame makes us fear, when fear and shame combine to make us pine, and cry under the flaming wrath of the ireful God, as those in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10. <hi>If our transgressions, and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then iive?</hi> Then is there a time for us to betake our selves to Christ's mercy, and to repose our sadded grieved, vulnerated, troubled hearts into the loftest armes of tenderness, rest, peace, and all his heavenly delicacies, and to say as <hi>David</hi> once (<hi>Psal.</hi> 39.11.) whose words are thus rendred in your English Meeter.
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Lord, take from me thy scourge, and plague,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>I can them not withstand;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>I faint and pine away for fear</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Of thy most heavy hand.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To the Question, which is, <hi>How we must sit down under that sweetest shadow of Christs tenderest Mercy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, That to resolve this Question, I shall give you these following Directives for the manner of it; As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You must seek for this shadow,</hi> as other creatures, Horses, Mules, Kine do, for a creature shadow. <hi>When the labouring Sun hath wrought his track, upon the top of loughty Cancers back,</hi> and when the same
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32247:27"/>flaming Torch doth dart it's burning heat upon their backs, so let us seek the shadow of Christs sweetest Mercy, to sit, to rest, to repose our selves there-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that both in the Word preacht, and read, and prayer. Beloved, this seeking after Christ, and resting, or sitting under the shadow of his Mercy is a chief thing. God himself requireth it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord.</hi> And, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Seek ye my Face;</hi> and how carefully have Souls desiring Christ done it? As for example, The Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1. <hi>By night, on my bed, I sought him whom I loved.</hi> So that Parabollical Merchant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.45, 46. How he sought for goodly pearls, and especially that pearl of great price, which is Christ with his sweetest Merits and Mercy: and should not we therefore so seek after him too, considering what a rest we shall enjoy, if we can find him, and find out his shadow, to sit there under? The very Devils seek rest, and find none, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43. and shall not we, who may be sure to find some, I mean that rest, which cometh, when we come to sit down under the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est shadow of his tenderest Mercy? For what saith himself, <hi>Seek, and ye shall find, Luke</hi> 11.9. Peruse also for this purpose, that famous Scripture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>And the Lord, whom ye seek;</hi> mark, whom ye seek; namely, Christ, <hi>shall suddenly come to his Temple.</hi> O sweet seeking! Many seek and find not, but who ever sought Christ as he must be sought, and found him not? So that your labour of seeking <hi>after the Lord, will not be in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:32247:28"/> 2. <hi>But then you must even set your selves to seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and his mercy, and that rest which cometh by him, and by sitting under the shadow of his Mercy.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as <hi>Daniel</hi> once did set his face to seek God; by prayer, and supplications, with fasting, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. So do you set your selves, and your faces in earnest to Christ-ward, to sit down under him, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to seek after him, with your prayers, and supplications also, and by all manner of means else, which is more than bare seeking. Here take these two sub-directions with you. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To set your selves in good earnest to seek after Christ, and the shadow of his mercy, set up a serious and solemn resolution so to do, as Christs Spouse did; saying, <hi>I will rise now therefore, and seek him whom my soul loveth, Cant.</hi> 3.2. So let every one of you say likewise, and so will I, by the grace of my God; Arise now, this very day, in the which I have heard the Preacher speak so much of Christs sweetest sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and seek him whom my soul loveth, and after the shadow of his tender mercy which my soul so much needeth, and I will set about it, and set my self with all seriousness, and earnestness to it. Thus resolve, and the Lord strengthen you in so good and gracious a purpose, you setting your selves to the work to some purpose.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To set your selves to this work, being so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, put all your strength, all your endeavours, and your whole heart to it, both in prayer and out of prayer, for then you may be sure to find. We have a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32247:28"/>notable place for it, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.29. <hi>But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him; if thou shalt seek him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.</hi> Put to it therefore my Brethren, put to it, and let your whole hearts go, and your whole souls go to seek after Christ, and his sweetest sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow especially in prayer (concerning which you will have more yet in the last Motive) do so, as <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> did when he set himself to seek God; go and even cry in prayer, saying, <hi>Lord Jesus, thou art he whom my soul desireth, and thy Mercy the shadow which she needeth; and therefore, where shall I find thee and it? Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon; for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? Cant.</hi> 1.7. And, Lord, where is the shadow of thy Mercies, which I so want in my grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous agonies? For, Oh the heat of thy wrath! Oh the height of thy furie, which oft times is even ready to sink me! O my God, I can no longer forbear this shadow of thy mercy, because I can no longer bear thy Fathers fury; nor can I bear up possibly, nor hold out, amidst those many pressures, which I meet with continually, unless this thy shadow cover me, and thy self hold up my head graciously. Hide me therefore under the shadow of thy wings secretly, I humbly and heartily beseech thee. Here be large, and as earnest as you can possibly be, setting your selves to the finding out of this shadow of Christs sweetest Mercy, that it may refresh you graciously. And with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:32247:29"/>all, take this as a Corollary with you, and choose the morning especially for this seeking; a time which I for my part do take for this set-seeking as chief; and the rather because of that famous place, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.23. <hi>The Lords mercies are new every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> So that the morning time will be your only time; the sooner the better, though it be a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, after the example of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.24. Yea, Christ himself who rose a great while before day, and prayed, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.35.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Then come away,</hi> For, <hi>Know you not that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? Rom.</hi> 2.4. so that to partake of this goodness, you must depart from wickedness; and therefore I say, you must come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, even as those which go to sit down under the shadow of a tree, do come away from the scorching heat of that burning Lamp, the Sun, I mean, beaming upon their heads, in the canicular and hottest dayes of all the Summer. So do you come away from your burning lusts, and away from your hottest pursuits af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your sensual delights, your carnal sports, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, your covetous practises (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14.) your worldly-mindedness, your revengsul contrivements, your greedy encro<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>chments, your malicious and spiteful proceeds, and all your other vile and filthy deeds. Or thus, Let Christ himself bespeak you (it may be, you will rather hear him than me) <hi>Come with me from Lebanon, my Spouse, with me from Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon; look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the Lyons dens, from the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32247:29"/>Mountaines of the Leopards,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.7. Mark where we are, before we come to Christ, and away with Christ; we are in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> that is, in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, some of us, grosse, or close; for <hi>Lebanon</hi> signifieth dealbation (and so denotes hypocrisie, or hypocrites, which are like whited sepulchres, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27.) and lieth towards the north of <hi>Judea,</hi> and is cold, as also hypocrisie is, wanting the fire of Christs burning love. Again, we are some of us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of <hi>Seir,</hi> which is part of <hi>Hermon,</hi> which lieth east-ward beyond <hi>Jordan, Deut.</hi> 3.8, 9. and of <hi>Amana,</hi> which northward separates <hi>Cilicia</hi> from <hi>Syria:</hi> I say, we are upon these three tops, that is, Lust of the flesh, lust of the eye, typed out by <hi>Seir</hi> and <hi>Hermon,</hi> both parts of one (lust namely) and pride of Life; which like <hi>Amana,</hi> separateth grace and nature: For, <hi>God giveth grace to the humble,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. which grace divideth between nature and it self in the humble. Again, we are some of us in the Lyons den, that is, like Lyons our selves for fierceness and cruelty, and companions of such; and many of us upon the mountaines of the Leopards, that is, mounted upon the very height of falshood, hypocrisie and dissimulation, and so like Leopards, which are said to be very false, and cunning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful creatures. Now, from all this, we must come away, with, and for Christ, for else we cannot take the shadow of Christs mercy, and be cruel our selves, and shew no mercy; we cannot sit down under the shadow of his grace, and yet want grace; we cannot
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32247:30"/>rest our selves in his goodness, and yet sit down in the chair of wickedness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.1. we cannot live so comfortably, and yet carry our selves contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, proudly, wantonly: No, no. And therefore let us leave what formerly we did love, let us come away from <hi>Seir</hi> and <hi>Hermon,</hi> I mean, from the lusts of the eye, and the lusts of the flesh, after this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; let us foregoe the tops of <hi>Amana,</hi> or pride of life, and the dens of Lyons, to go to the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> let us forsake the Mountains of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling Leopards, I mean falshood and hypocrisie, to partake of Christs sweetest Mercy, or else it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. And on the contrary, if we shall so do, or do as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> once did, when they put away their strange gods, that is, shall put away our strange sins, which are like their gods, God will soon have mercy on us as he had on them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.16. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Translation is, <hi>es lammert him,</hi> which is a most emphatical expression; as if he should say, the Lord so laid their misery to his heart, as if it had been his own. Semblably whereunto, he will lay our misery to his heart, and be afflicted when we are afflicted, grieve when we are grieved, repent when we repent, leave when we leave; that is to say, will leave punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we leave sinning.</p>
            <p>But I must add two things more, which I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgotten.</p>
            <p>The 1. is, As the Spouse, setting her self to seek her Beloved, left her bed, and rose, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.2. so must you in a special manner, leave your beds of love,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32247:30"/>of ease, of sloath, and come over them to come over to Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As she, to rest on her beloved, and to sit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, came out of the wilderness, wherein she formerly was, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8. So must we, if we would sit down under the shadow of Christs mercy, come away from resting in duties, and in our doings; for is not this like resting in a wilderness, wherein no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, that is, no comfort to be had, nor any one drop of mercy, God resisting the proud, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. and so consequently refusing to shew them mercy. So that such proud Pharisees, who trust and rest in their hypocritical doings, can no more look to be justified by Christs mercy, than that proud Pharisee, who so boasted of his works, and rested in them, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 12, 14. The danger of which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein such Pharisees, and stately hypocrites are, I will set forth by this familiar comparison. It is with the Soul of a poor Sinner, as with the body of a man; if it be troubled with a slight disease, he may easily be helped, but if the throat begin to swell, and the vital parts be stopt up, that it can receive no meat, every neighbour will say, he is but a dead man, all the means in the world cannot save him, because he can let nothing down. So, though the Soul be full of corruptions, and ill humours, it may be saved; but if it swell with pride, because of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as praying, fasting, reading, hearing, and rest in those duties, all the means upon earth cannot help it, to bring it to heaven. And as hard a thing it is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32247:31"/>to convert such a soul, and bring it to the faith of Christ, as any thing under heaven. See for this, that notable place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 6. <hi>Cursed be the man that departs from the Lord (by trusting in the creature)</hi> and then, mark what followeth; <hi>for he shall be like the heath in the Desart,</hi> that is, in his resting in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (which is, as I said, like a Desart) <hi>and shall not see when good cometh,</hi> namely, Mercy shewed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who trust in Christ. Beloved, all the showers that come from heaven, cannot make a Desart fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; so all the meanes under heaven, cannot make a soul which rests in Duties, fruitful for heaven; So that seldom such a proud soul is won to the Faith, to win Heaven: For, <hi>How can ye believe,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>which receive honour one of another,</hi> as those do who rest in Duties, and are so proud upon them, <hi>John</hi> 5.45. Come away therefore from this false resting, if you mean to come to Christ, and to that true resting on Christ, which only pleaseth Christ, else you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>You must stoope,</hi> and become humble, and low, as those do who sit, and especially upon the ground under a tree. Humility, or humiliation is Gods Daughter, and the dowry which he giveth with this Daughter is Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. and therefore he that will have this dowry, and with it obtain mercy, must marry this Daughter; as he that would have <hi>Naomi's</hi> Field, must also get, and take her Daughter, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4.5. You have read, I suppose, what others have done in the like case; as for instance, <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:32247:31"/>how he humbled himself, and so obtained mercy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. <hi>And when he was in affliction he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him; and he was intreated of him, and heard his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and brought him again to Jerusalem. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God.</hi> So how the King of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> with his <hi>Ninivites,</hi> humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so obtained mercy, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.6. Mark, he sate in ashes, before he could sit down under the shadow of mercy, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.2, 11. And how <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> humbled her self, before she obtained mercy. You have read, I believe, in <hi>Luke</hi> 7.38, 47. And what saith God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. <hi>To this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.</hi> And St. <hi>James, Chap.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Humble your selves in the sight of the Lord, and he will lift you up.</hi> So that needs you must first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come low, if you will be high; bow, and be down, if you will be up; be abased, if you will be exalted; be dejected, if you will be consolated; be in Misery, if you will obtain Mercy. For these two Mercy &amp; Misery,
<note n="*" place="margin">Bernard.</note> as one saith well, are Relatives. No misery, no mercy: all which hath caused such memorable passages to drop from holy mens, and learned Writers pens. <hi>God pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the oyl of mercy,</hi>

               <hi>Austin</hi> once, especially if you never obtained mercy yet, nor ever were converted yet; that is to say, as he, to obtain Mercy, when the time of his conversion was at hand, went into his Hosts Garden, and there fell all along under a fig-tree, crying and saying, <hi>How long Lord, how long? Why not now? Why should not this day be the last day of my shame? &amp;c.</hi> So do you also go into a Garden, or under a Tree, or into your Closets, and there fall down before the Lord (I have done so my self also, when I thought the time of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version was come) and cry, and say, Why not now, why not now, Lord? Why may not this be the last day of our shame? Oh how long? how long, Lord, shall we wallow so in mire, in dirt, in dung, in sin, and how long wilt thou be angry with our poor souls? Shall thine anger burn for ever? wilt thou shut up thy bowels in displeasure for ever? Shall we never never be remembred? O think upon us now at last, now this very day, and let this be the last day of our shame. <hi>Turn us, O God, of our salvation, and shew us
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32247:32"/>thy mercy, and grant us thy salvation,</hi> Psal. 85.47. Nay, do even here condemn your selves before the Lord, saying, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Lord, unto us belongs shame, and confusion of faces,</hi> and unto us appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death, and Damnation, and Hell fire for ever; and we can look for nothing else, in this our sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, unless thou look upon us with eyes of pity, and shew us thy compassion; here bring your selves as low as may be, the lower the better, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler in misery, the fitter for mercy; and therefore charge your selves as much as you can, with an enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of your great and grievous offences, with their several circumstances, of time when, places where, and persons against whom, they were committed; to bring your selves sensible both of the weight of your grievous sinnes, and also of the direfull wrath of the Almighty, and of that formidable punishment of hell fire for ever, due to the same, that so you may be thereby fitted for mercy, when you shall have made your selves thus sensible, of your great and greivous misery, and may be able to cry with <hi>David, out of the Depths,</hi> namely, of misery, <hi>have I cried unto thee, O Lord,</hi> Psal. 13.21. <hi>And Deep calleth unto Deep,</hi> Psal. 42.7. That is, the deep of misery calleth to the deep of mercy. And if you will we ruled by me, take this as a Corollary with you, and do all this fasting, as <hi>Daniel</hi> once; who when he sought God with prayer, and supplication, did it fasting, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>You must acquiesce in and rest on Christ, and so under the shadow of his mercy;</hi> for so he that sirs, rests, when and where he sitteth. This is meant, as I take
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32247:33"/>it, by that sweet, and notable Expression, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Leaning upon her Beloved.</hi> Beloved, lean therefore upon your Beloved, and your Beloved will lean toward you, when he shal see you so to lean upon him; for mark what followeth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.5. <hi>I raised thee up under the apple-tree,</hi> that is, when thou wast come to me, and under me, as an apple-tree, both for shadow and for apples; apples, namely of comfort, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of mercy, being faint, and didst even rely upon me, and rest on me; then, and there, I raised thee up being down, and spake comfortably to thee, because thou didst so desire me. So that by all meanes, you must take up your Rest here, having left resting in duties, and having nothing else to trust to, and to rest in, especially when with inward props and stayes all outward supports also fail you, then lay hold on Christ, and rest your selves under the shadow of his wings, saying, as it is in the prayer of <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Although the Fig-tree shall not blossome, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall fruit be in the vine, the labour of the Olive shall fail, and the fields shall yeild no meat, the flocks shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no heards in the stall; yet will I Rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hindes feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.</hi> And <hi>Isa.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Behold God is my salvation, I will trust, and not be affraid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I must resolve three Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:32247:33"/>
            <p> The first is, I would rest here were it not for this, that I am so void of good and so full of evil, as that I think there is not a viler wretch than my self; for this I doubt whether the Lord Jesus will have mercy on me, yea or no.</p>
            <p>To this I Answer. Never doubt of that, for what saith the Apostle? <hi>This is a faithful saying, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief; Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15, 16. Mark, Thou thinkest that there is not a viler wretch living, where thou livest; but <hi>Paul</hi> saith no, I am chief, the chief of sinners, and so a greater sinner than thou, and yet obtained mercy; and should not this cause thee to rest here?</p>
            <p n="2">2. But I know what thou wilt say further. <hi>Paul</hi> did what he did ignorantly, and therefore obtained mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answ.</hi> 1. It is true. He did what he did igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, namely, against Christians, and Christ whom he knew not, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.5. But do you think that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sinned against his knowledge else, being a man of so much Knowledge as he had, by his Testimony, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.7. And besides, did ye never read, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how even after his conversion, he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his sins, which doubtless he committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his knowledge? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 19, 23, 24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And did not <hi>David</hi> sin against his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the matter of <hi>Ʋriah,</hi> and <hi>Bathsheba?</hi> Did
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32247:34"/>not he know that Adultery was a sin, a foul sin, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sin, a crying sin, think ye? Yes doubtless: See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.15. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So <hi>Peter,</hi> did not he sin against his knowledge when he denied his Master? Did he not know him, when he said, <hi>I know not the man, and sware to it, Matth.</hi> 26.74.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But I have obstinately and willfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in my wickedness, and even turned grace it self into lasciviousness, and despised all the meanes which have been used for my salvation, and have spent my youthful dayes upon my lusts, and stood it out so long; and will the Lord shew me mercy now at last?</p>
            <p>I Answer, This is an heavy case I must confess, but yet I hope, I shall resolve thee. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Was not <hi>Manasseh</hi> not only as great a sinner as any, but also an old one, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.1. and one that stood it out against all meanes used for him? <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. Nay, did he not, as
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Chron. Char. pag.</hi> 30.</note> some write, cause his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chaplain, the Prophet <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> who laboured all that he could to reclaim him, to be sawne asunder, as that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. seemeth to confirm the said relation; notwithstanding which he obtained Mercy, <hi>vers.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And what was the theif upon the Cross? did he not spend his youthful dayes in stealing, and robbing? Did he not continue in sin to the last? <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.40, 41, 42, 43.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:32247:34"/> 3. And what saith the most merciful God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven himself, concerning himself; <hi>the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering,</hi> Exod. 34.6. Mark he calleth himself, not onely by the name of merciful, but also long-suffering, to shew that he can bear, and doth bear, and forbear the greatest of sinners a long time, even many years; as the above said <hi>Manasseh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.1.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And doth not the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the same? nay, doth he not affirme more than the same saying? <hi>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy; that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering:</hi> Thus far he saith the same, and then, more than the same in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; <hi>for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him,</hi> and so rest on him to life everlasting. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. Mark, Christs design in <hi>Pauls</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, was to make him a pattern for you that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Case, and for all that shall believe on his name; so that if you can but savingly believe on his name, and rely upon him for his merits, sitting down under the shadow of his sweetest mercy; though you be down, yet you shal be up, though in your selves you had received the sentence of death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, yet in him, and for him, and by him you shall receive the sentence of absolution; though long you have swam down the streames of sinful, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Delectation, yet through his longsuffering and the riches of his grace, you shall, even in this life, receive your spiritual Consolations, and in the world to come
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32247:35"/>the salvation of your souls, to an endless Duration. Nay, my Brethren, even that sweetest saying of the Apostle, which I said but now, doth confirm this same: How like that glorious luminarie, and lampe of heaven, the Sun I mean, it shineth brighter and brighter in mine eyes! for I do now see more, much more in it now, then I saw first, because the Apostle doth not only tell us, that he obtained mercy, that in him Christ might shew forth long-suffering, but all longsuffering; mark, all longsuffering; not only some in some, but all, for any time that can be named, and in all that should believe, how long soever; whether 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 80, years, or upwards, they have persisted in sin, and resisted the Spirit of God by sin. Thus all long-suffering, and so consequently that also which reacheth even to those which have spent their youthful dayes upon their lusts, and those which have stood it out against the very meanes of grace used for their recovery, and that whereby he can bear and hath born with some forty years, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.10. and with others, one hundred and twenty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. intending thereby to lead them to Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. For else how can it be all long-suffering? O sweet affirmation! O confirmation worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation! Oh how this should now satisfie, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the doubts and hesitations of poor perplexed sinners! Oh how it should even fully, absolutely, indisputably, ungainsayingly, perswade any of all that hear me, or shall read these sayings, to rest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now at last, though it be never, though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32247:35"/>so late, on Christ for Mercy. But, yet I do not speak this to strengthen the hands of the wicked in their wickedness, nor yet to settle them upon their lees, or to sow Cushions under their elbows; No, no, but all that I have said, is said for the Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, support, and animation, of poor, weary, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, labouring, repenting, believing sinners; for such only are invited by Christ to come to Christ, as I have formerly shewed out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. As for others that are impenitent, and resolve to abide where they are, and to continue in sin, that grace may abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. and yet presume to rely upon Christ for mercy; I must and shall tell them, that not one drop of all that Ocean of love, which floweth in the tender bowels of Christ, not one dram of all that precious oar of grace, which lieth hid in the rich mines of his mercy, not one beam of all that light and lightsomness which beams from that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and All-gracious Son of Righteouesness, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to them, nor will ever come for them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by a true, and lively faith, and with unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance they come to Christ; Christ being resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in such a case, not to save them, nor to shew mercy to them, though he shew mercy to thousands, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. nor to make them partakers of the riches of his grace, though he be full of grace, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.12. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. More Objections will be answered hereafter.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>You must do what herein you mean to do quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:32247:36"/>as Christ said once, <hi>John</hi> 13.17. running as it were to and under this shadow, as other creatures do run under a shadowy tree. For as now God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all men every where to repent, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. So now by a necessary consequence he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to accept of mercy, and would not have them to harden their hearts against Mercy, as some do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>But to day</hi> (saith he) <hi>when you hear his voice</hi> (Psal. 95.7.) <hi>harden not your hearts.</hi> Or thus, as Christ once said to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when he had got himself upon a Sycamore Tree, from thence to see Christ, who was higher than that tree; <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, make haste and come down, for to day I must abide at thy house,</hi> Luke 19.5. So he saith to thee that now also hearest me, and being upon a Sycamore tree, where Christ and Mercy have espied thee; that is, upon the Tree of sin, which is the vilest thing in the world, as the Sycamore, the vilest of all the Trees in the world, as

Christ.</note> one writes of it, thinking from thence, and thereupon, or continuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to see Christ and his Mercy, which will never be, nor can be: Make haste, come down man, or, thou <hi>Peter,</hi> thou <hi>John,</hi> thou <hi>Mary</hi> by name, for I mean to abide this day, saith Christ, in thy heart; and so saith his Mercy, and I also mean this day to come to thy heart, and therefore, O dear soul, tarry no longer upon thy Sycamore Tree, the Tree I mean of Lust, of Gluttony, of Drunkenness, and the like sins, which are like Sycamore Trees,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32247:36"/>that grow in moist places, and in <hi>Egypt</hi> especially, that moist countrey, if you mean to obtain, and to entertain Christ and his Mercy: And that, as I said, this very day. For, as <hi>Boaz</hi> said to <hi>Naomies</hi> kinsman, <hi>What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess,</hi> Ruth 4.5. So say I, <hi>Qua die desponsaris Christo &amp; Miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae ejus, eodem die te oportet, ducere poenitentiam quoque;</hi> that is, The same day wherein thou despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latest thy self to Christ and his Mercy, the self-same day thou must also repent, and come down from the tree of sin and misery; because these two things are so by God himself joyned together, as that no man must put them asunder, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. Wherefore let me entreat thee, that thou wilt stand there, and stand out no longer, no, not a day longer, but wilt entertain Christ with his mercy, like <hi>Zacheus,</hi> this very day, penitently and joyfully, that you may be able to say, as Christ of the house of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> truly this day came Christ and his mercy to my heart gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously. But this I shall pass over yet in one of these Motives.</p>
            <p>Need you Incentives, or Motives, then consider these Six.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods and his servants willingness, yea Mercies its self, of your sitting down under the shadow of Christs Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Comfortableness of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Seasonableness of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Rareness of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:32247:37"/> 5. <hi>The Delightfulness of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The Needfulness of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods and his servants willingness, yea Mercies its self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Motive hath three Branches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first is Gods willingness.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Father bids, and entreats you to sit down, and to accept of Mercy; saying, <hi>As I live, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye,</hi> (loe how earnest he is, he bids you twise) <hi>from your evil wayes; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. As if he should say, I pray you therefore accept of my mercy, according to that noted place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>As though God did beseech you by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Son bids you, and begs with you to sit down, saying, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden.</hi> As if he should say, I pray you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Mercy, and I will give you rest, for sitting down under the shadow of my mercy brings rest, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Spirit bids you, and entreateth you to sit down; For, <hi>The Spirit and the Bride say, Come, Rev.</hi> 22.17. As if he should say, I pray you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His Servants are willing,</hi> and bid and entreat you to sit down. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> So the Apostle, speaking in the Name of all, entreats you, saying, <hi>Now then, we are Embassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32247:37"/>you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. As if he should say, We pray you all, to sit down under the shadow of Christs wings, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And my unworthy-self pray you also in Christs stead to be reconciled to God (because unto me also, as I am a Minister of Christ, is committed the word of Reconciliation by Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18.) and so consequently to accept of Mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Nay, Mercy it self</hi> doth as it were speak to you, and bid you and entreat you to sit down under her, and to accept of her, saying, I beseech you in Christs name, be reconciled to God, and accept of my proffer. Thus I bring in Mercy her self, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating us, as the Apostle brings in Christs love it self, as constraining us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. And will you not be entreated now, by so many entreaties? will you not be overcome by so many invitations, so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently come? Is it nothing with you, that as the Prodigals Father came forth himself, and entreated his elder son to come in, and to sit down, as the rest of his invited guests, at his younger brothers feast, when he saw that he would not come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.28. So God the Father himself comes forth to you and entreats you to come in, and to sit down at your elder Brothers feast, which his mercy maketh; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he seeth that you will not come in? is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with you that the whole Trinity entreats you? Is it nothing that <hi>Paul</hi> in the name of all the Lords Prophets and holy Apostles invites you? Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32247:38"/>that Mercy her self, which also is God himself, (to say nothing of my worthless-self) doth pray you so? If there were a very sumptuous feast at a great Lords house, made for his Son, and one of you should accidentally come to that Lords house the same time, after many of his invited guests are set down, and the Servants should entreat him to come in, nay that Lord himself should come out, and invite him to come in and to sit down with the rest of his guests, and then the Son also should come forth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him, and after him his most intimate friend, which is next to him, should come likewise and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him to come in; yea, suppose farther, that great Lords Lady her self should come forth also, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him to come in, and sit down at that sumptuous feast; I ask, whether that man could find in his heart to be so uncivil, and so obstinate as to say, I will not come in? I conceive he could not. And will ye, or any one of you be so wilful, and so unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to be like the Prodigals elder brother, refusing to come in when as that great Lord of Heaven, and Earth, having made and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a far greater

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32247:38"/>feast, and under Mercies shadow? O by no means, by no means. Beloved, if you do not regard me, nor my entreaties, nor will do any thing for my sake, yet come and sit down now, after so many entreaties of such eminent persons as those three glorious person<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the blessed and ever to be adored Trinity are; and for the sake of the holy Apostles, and of Mercy it self to be magnified for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Consider the comfortableness of it, and that in four Respects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In respect of the Greatness of Christs Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In respect of the muchness of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In respect of the swiftness of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>In respect of the Lastingness of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>In respect of the Greatness of it. For thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is great to the Heavens,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 57.10. And <hi>the Lord is of great Mercy;</hi> Or, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath, <hi>Great in Mercy,</hi> Psal. 145.8. that is, his Greatness. Now the greater the shadow of a tree is, the more comfortable that shadow is; and therefore how comfortable must the shadow of Christs mercy needs be, which is so great as that it reacheth to the Heavens! so that a thousand thousand thousand sinnes of yours and mine may be covered with it, and many thousands more, when Gods fierce wrath wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hot against them, hide and shelter themselves under it. In the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> the mercies of

So that this doth for ever silence that great cry which many a man makes, about the greatness of sins, saying, O my sins, how great they be! even so great that I fear they will never be forgiven me: For saith Christ, be it so, that thy sins are great, yet despair not, for as thou art a great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, so am I a great Saviour, and as thy sins are great, so my mercies are great, even greater than thy sins

So that here there is a Sea of sweetness streaming from that Sea of mercy, which floweth in the bowels of Christ, and a world of comfort arising from that high and lofty Tree of Life, Christ I mean, whose most refreshing shadow of mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness reacheth (as you have heard out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 57.10.) to the heavens, and is greater than all our sins and misery.

Again, had the lamps of your lives shined in the dayes of Christ, the heavenly <hi>Solomon,</hi> had you been made to sit down with those five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of people which Christ fed, and filled, with five loaves and two fishes, had you eaten of those wonderful loaves and fishes, had you been so satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with them as they were, had you seen how much was left for many more, you would have told what a sweet what a comfortable, what an acceptable sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and eating that was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.17, 18, 19. Well, this sitting down by, and under the shadow of Christ, who is greater than <hi>Solomon, Matth.</hi> 12.42. And this sitting down (I will not say upon the green grass, as that peoples sitting was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.19. but upon, or rather under, the Lords great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heaps of Mercy, but now spoken of) is infinitely, incomparably swerter than both <hi>Bathsheba</hi>'s was, and that Peoples was.

Oh that God would bring your hearts to it! that you may no longer defer it. Amen, So be it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But I have not yet done with this comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness (for all this text is for comfortableness) you must also consider how comfortable this sitting is, <hi>in respect of the muchness of Gods mercy.</hi> For what saith the Lord, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for thousands.</hi> What saith that sweet singer of <hi>Israel</hi> of this muchness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86.5. <hi>For thou Lord art good, and ready to forgive, and plentious;</hi> Mark, plentious in mercy, unto all them, them that call upon thee; and so to you also, if you call upon him, namely as you ought, and as I have taught you, for mercy. See also, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.7. <hi>But as for me, I will come into thy house, in the multitude of thy mercy.</hi> And there are no less than five places which say, that God is even full of compassions, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.38. 86.15. 111.4. 113.4. 145.8. Which sheweth what a world of mercy and compassion, therefore there is in him, he being infinite, so that his mercy must needs he infinite too, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, many more than there are creatures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth; because God is greater than both, and yet full of compassions. And is not Christ infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, as God, said to be full of grace also, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. So that if thou wert as full of sin as the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:32247:41"/>were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29, 30, 31. being filled with malice, wrath, anger, lusts, and hadst had eyes full of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. and thy mouth full of cursing and bitterness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.14. yet thou needest not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, upon a true repentance and conversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is so full of compassion, Again, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly told you also how the mercy of Christ is like the great Sea, out of <hi>Micah,</hi> 7.19. Now can any of you tell those infinite drops of water, which are in that Ocean of water? I know you cannot; nor can you tell those <hi>infinite, infinite</hi> mercies, which are in that Ocean of mercy, which is God infinite and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ever. So that if thy sins were as many as the sins of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> which were more than the sands on the Sea-shore, yet those infinite mercies which are in the God of mercy, would cover them all, and ten thousand times more, if thou hadst committed so many more; because they are so many, even as those waters which are in the Sea, cover all those infinite, infinite sands which are in the Sea. So plenteous is Christ in mercy, even beyond all apprehension, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, and imagination; I speak it to thy great and unspeakable consolation, if thou be penitent. For this now thorowly resolveth that grand Objection. I confess I am not guilty of such gross sins, as some are; but Ministers tell us, that as a ship being fraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with overmuch small sand, may sink into the Sea, as well as one that is fraighted and filled with great and heavy stones, so a soul which is full of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand evil thoughts, and guilty of more than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32247:42"/>evil deeds, which by many are counted to be but small offences, will sink into hell, as well as that man whose soul stands guilty of, and is fraighted with such great, and heinous sins, as are like great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy stones; and therefore I fear there is no mercy to be had for me, whose case this is, for I must confess that my soul is as full of such thoughts, as the Sea is full of sands; and that I have besides that, done and spoken so much evil, though not in so gross a manner as some, as that I am not able to number those evils which I have spoken and done, because they are so many. I say, this muchness of Christ's mercy, which I am now upon, will clear all this. For saith Christ, by way of concession, be it granted to thee, poor trembling soul, that it is so with thee as thou hast said, yet despair not, for as thy sins are many, and like swarmes, and like sands for multitude, so are my mercies many, nay many more. Go and number the Stars, if thou art able to number them, as God once said to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.5. but I know thou canst nor, and if thou canst not number them, be sure thou canst not number my mercies neither, for they are more than the Stars; and therefore if thy sins were as many as the Stars in the spangled skie, yet would I not have thee to despond, because I am full of compassion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.38. <hi>Psal.</hi> 111.4. <hi>and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in mercy, Psal.</hi> 86.15. <hi>And I will redeem Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el from all his iniquities, Psal.</hi> 130.8.

And did not the Prodigal's Father even run to meet his Son, when the Son did but go towards his Father? <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. To shew, that God is more swift to meet us in the way of mercy, than we are to meet him, as we are coming away towards him out of the wayes of misery: And the reason of it is, because it is natural to him to shew mercy, and to be merciful; for his Mercy is nothing else but his Nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as

            <p> I have read of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, King of <hi>England,</hi> that when a certain holy Martyr, called <hi>John Badly,</hi> was to be burnt in <hi>Kent, Anno</hi> 1409. and as he was in the fire cryed, Mercy, Mercy, the said King caused the fire to be put out to save his life, thinking he had called to him for mercy, when he in very deed cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the King of Kings for mercy, as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterward: however, this I must confess did shew in that King a readiness to shew mercy to him that should cry to him for mercy; but I must tell you my Brethren, that my Lord and Master, whose name is King of Kings, is not only as ready as he to shew mercy to such as call upon him for mercy (as appears in <hi>Manasseh's</hi> case, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. and from that fore-alleadged <hi>Psal.</hi> 86.5. <hi>For thou Lord art ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee.</hi> Mark to all that call upon him, and cry mercy, when they are, like that Martyr, in the fire of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and feel the fire of the Lords great indignation) but much more: for that fore-mentioned King caused the same holy Martyr to be burnt for all, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward crying, mercy Lord, Jesus, Jesus Christ, mercy, because he understood he called upon Christ and not him, for mercy, and refused his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered stipend; but the King of Kings will never, never cause those to be burnt in the fire of hell, whom once he frees from the fire and fury of sin, crying for mercy to him, in the same words of the same Martyr, and saying, Mercy, Lord Jesus, Mercy. Nay such is his readiness to forgive, as that if a poor
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32247:44"/>penitent, believing, trembling soul doth but say, I will confess my sins to him, he forgiveth it before he doth it; as you may see in <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. <hi>I said I will confess my transgression to the Lord, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavest the iniquity of my sinne. Selah.</hi> So swift is the Lords indulgence, so hasty his benevolence; let me say therefore in this place, every one of you, as once the Lord said to <hi>Paul</hi> in a trance, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.18. <hi>make hast, and get thee out of Jerusalem quickly; For they will not receive thy Testimony concerning me.</hi> So make haste to get thee, I will not say out of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but out of thy Natural condition, and out of thy lazy condition, wherein now thou art, quickly, for that will not suffer thee to receive my testimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy, nor to accept of the proffers which mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy makes to thee; that so being out, thou mayest cry out, Mercy, Lord Jesus Christ, mercy; and that the Lord may let you know, and see by proofe the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his mercy; for which great Mercy, I beseech his heavenly Highness heartily.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>In respect of the lastingness of it, for his mercy endures for ever, and his compassions faile not,</hi> Lam. 3.22. Psal. 106.1. <hi>and</hi> Isa. 54.10. <hi>The mountaines shall depart; and the hills be removed; but my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall not depart from thee, saith the Lord.</hi> Oh the stability of the Lords benignity, which is said to be firmer than the hills and mountaines, that we might have strong, and sure consolation thorow its acceptation. I pray observe this, <hi>Oh thou afflicted,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:32247:44"/>tossed with tempest, and not comforted;</hi> that followeth immediately, <hi>v.</hi> 11. For this also clearly answers another great doubt of many a poor, comfortless, troubled soul, which saith I must confess that I am much changed, blessed be God, but then, I am fallen much from what I have been, and do too too often relapse, to the doing of that which I should not do; and that makes me doubt many many times, whether Christs mercy do belong to me, yea, or no. This, this lastingness of Christs mercy answers; For, saith Christ, be it so Dear soul as thou sayest, that thou art so fallen, and dost so Relapse; yet doubt not if thou have a care, to rise again, and be heartily sorry for it; For my mercy is an everlasting mercy, and it is new every morning, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.23. and whom I love once, I love to the end, <hi>John</hi> 13.1. and again he saith <hi>Can a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the fruit of her wombe? yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee,</hi> Isa. 49.11. <hi>Mark,</hi> here is Mercy and Love passing the love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not only of women, but of mothers, for lastingness and continuance; and should not the consideration of it even draw you to Christ, whose compassions never, never fail? <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. though we both▪ <hi>fail</hi> and <hi>fall.</hi>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32247:45"/>sings new songs of mercy still, and hath new kindes of modes, and variety of comfortable speeches still to fill our hearts and ears with new Songs of mercy still; because his mercy endureth for ever. <hi>David</hi> is much spoken of for his sweet lesson penned down in <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. and compared by some to a Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale for it; because he so doubles and trebles in it, as a Nightingale doth, when she is upon a sweet tone and note; repeating the same note of ever-during mercy, twenty fix times one after another, for so often he saith it, <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever, his mercy endureth for ever, his merey endureth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp;c.</hi> But the best of musitians, which is our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, how often doth he repeat over and over his sweet songs of mercy, how he doubles and trebles when he is in that tone! I dare say, he saith it a thousand thousand times over to a thousand thousand souls; nay, he uttereth new songs still, both by his Servants and Prophets, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, changing his Note a thousand times. One while he saith, I will be such a ones Father, and he shall be my Son; <hi>If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; but my mercy shall not be taken away from him,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.14, 15. Another while he saith, when he hath been a little while angry with us, and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us, <hi>For a little moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee: In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:32247:45"/>Isa. 54.6, 7. Another time, <hi>Thou hast played the Harlot with many lovers, yet turn again to me, saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 3.1. As if he should say; and I will receive thee into the armes of my mercy, though many be the sins wherein thou didst relapse, and fall back again into the same sink of sin, which my soul abhorreth. And another time, when out of frailty the soul is gone in to <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and hath dallied with lust, and played the wanton, even after illumination, as <hi>David,</hi> but now is wheeling about, and cries <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavi,</hi> saying, with the same <hi>David, I have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord, and done foolishly;</hi> therefore, <hi>Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy loving kindness, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.13. 2 Sam. 24.10. Psal. 51.1.

But I say again, and cannot say it too often, that I do not mention all these wonders of mercy, to animate any of the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> in their presumption upon these great and to be admired mercies of the Lord Jesus; No, no; but I must now after all this, knock oft their fingers from laying hold thereon, as I did formerly, and tell them to their very faces plainly and boldly, that Christ is not only like a Musician making pleasant mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick with his sweetest mercies, but also like a Bee, which, as it hath it sweet

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The seasonableness of it.</hi> Besoved, a thing may be comfortable and yet not seasonable; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a cold cup of water may be comfortable in a journey, and to a traveller, but not in a feaver, and to a febriciant; but this sitting under the shadow of mercy is both comfortable and seasonable, for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth us both in our travelling to heaven; and when we are like Febriciants in a grievous heat, being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick and set on fire, as it were by the burning wrath of of the God of heaven: Or thus, when journeying for heaven, we are ready to faint, because great is our fear that we shall be tired, before ever heaven will by us be acquired, to quail away, because long is out
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32247:46"/>way, to fall down because Gods wrath is against us, which from heaven is revealed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. and from him cometh down; then how seasonable as well as comfortable is Christs mercy, and our sitting down under the shadow of it! even as another shadow is to another creature, when it is scorched, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously inflamed with another calor? So that I do not press upon you an unse asonable thing, but that which is as seasonable as any thing; and as for you, I know you are all for that which is seasonable. For, do not ye usually say as well as <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 3.1. <hi>There is a season for all things;</hi> and this is a season for such a thing, and we will take it; and will ye not take this season, and lay hold on this seasonablness? Oh my brethren, can there be a greater seasonableness for you, to be taken by you, I ask ye? For, to give ye some few Instances more besides the former,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it not seasonable for us to do a thing, when it is high time to do it? and is it not high time for you to wheel about, as I taught you formerly, and to turn to God; to come away from sin for God, and by faith to sit down under the shadow of the mercy of God? Have ye not put that very thing off as much as any thing, from year to year, from moneth to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, from day to day, whilst almost every day doth say, every day.

So be you also perswaded upon true repentance, and by faith, to get into the same clifts, or wounds of Christ our Rock for shadow, for in Christs wounds there is also a shadow, even an over-shadowing shadow of mercy, of pity, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, for our unspeakable consolation. Some can speak of it from their own experience, what mercy they have found in these clifts, these wounds of Jesus Christ. I knew a man in Christ, who having been tossed a whole night about his Election, went
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32247:47"/>next morning, being the Lord's day, to a godly Minister, and opened his case to him, who told him as once <hi>Staupitius</hi> told <hi>Luther,</hi> in the like case; Brother, be of good Comfort, in the wounds of Christ thy Name is written; whereupon that man, though before he could not believe, nor receive any comfort at all, was immediately ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unspeakable Consolation. And therefore like so many Doves, get ye now forthwith to these clifts, and hide your selves in these wounds, crying as once those <hi>Hierosolomitans</hi> did, saying, <hi>Hosanna in the highest,</hi> that is, now save us thou that art in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.9. And now, shew us thy salvation, and now, <hi>have mercy on us, O God, according to thy loving-kindness; according to the multitude of thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies, blot out our transgressions, Psal.</hi> 51.1. Thus make haste, and be not by any means like <hi>Felix,</hi> who said to <hi>Paul, Go thy way, when I have conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent season, I will call for thee, Acts</hi> 24.25. For can there be a more convenient season for this than this? I press this haste the oftener, because there is great need of it, most men spoiling themselves by delayes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, Is it not seasonable for us to betake our selves to the shadow of Christs mercy, for Mercy; when it is with us, as it was with <hi>Niniveh</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Jonah,</hi> when the Lord had said concerning it, <hi>yet fourty dayes, and Niniveh shall be overthrown, Jonah</hi> 3.4. and when <hi>Jonah</hi> sate on the East-side of the City and made him a booth, and sate under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32247:48"/>of the City, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.5. For, is it not to be feared that the Lords decree is gone forth, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we repent, and flee to his mercy for Refuge, a great part of Christendome within such a time, will be overthrown? Is not the great Turkish Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Christian Territories? Doth not the grand Signior threaten us with a general Devastation? And is it not seasonable then for us to sit, I will not say on the East-side of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> or under the shadow of the Booth as <hi>Jonah</hi> did to see what will become of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi> but under the shadow of Christs mercy, crying and saying, Lord, what will become of poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, if thou at this time hold thy peace? <hi>Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thy biritage to Reproach, that the Heathen should Rule over them: wherefore should they say among the People, Where is their God? Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Ah Lord, for Zions sake, hold not thy peace, but shew us thy compassion; for we know thee,</hi> and knew the long before now, that <hi>thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth thee of evil;</hi> Jonah, 4.2. And thou Lord knowest, that as in <hi>Niniveh</hi> there were sixscore thousand, so in Christendome many thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left, and also, we will not say, much cattell, but many precious Saints, and sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> which cry to thee day and night, saying, Will not the Lord have mercy on <hi>Sion?</hi> will he not make <hi>Jerusalem</hi> a glory in all the earth? Is not the time near come for <hi>Jerusalem's</hi> walles to be built up,

               <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.18. Is not the time near come, which the Lord spake of by his servants the Prophets, saying, <hi>I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with saphyres, and I will make thy windowes of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbuncles, and all thy bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of pleasant stones,</hi> Isa. 54.11, 12. <hi>O do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion, build thou up the walls of Jerusalem,</hi> Psal. 51.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not seasonable for us to get us under the shadow of mercy, for mercy, when we are forsaken of God, as we are almost every day, Nay, are it may be, this very day; and shall not we go and cry to the Lord for mercy? saying every one of us that are so forsaken, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Psal. 22.1. O have mercy upon me, and, <hi>make haste my Beloved, and be like a Roe, or a young heart upon the mountains of spices, Cant.</hi> 8.14. that is, return as quickly as a young Hart, or Roe doth run, and let thy mercy also as speedily Return, and come with thee upon thy Saints; which like mountaines of spices, send forth their Redolent sent, and whose sent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is most sweet, and whose sweet prayers for Mercy, are like the sweet murmurs of Turtles in the clests of a Rock, when they are left by their fellowes, as the Saints also many times are; according to that sore-mentioned most famous Scripture, <hi>For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken, and greived in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God,</hi> Isa. 54.6.</p>

Most men are rather for the pleasant Sun-shine of sinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and of the sensual pleasures of sin for a season, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Rara avis in terris;</hi> he is a rare bird upon the earth, that cares for those mercies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; For not one of a thousand that doth; for though God be willing to shew mercy to thousands, <hi>not being willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. whereby it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that I do not perswade you to a thing which is vulgar, ordinary, common, but to one which is singular, extraordinary, and, as I shewed but now, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rare. Now, are we not all for rare things, Rare meets, rare sights, rare seats? Beloved, had you lived in the dayes of <hi>Moses,</hi> when the mercy-seat was up, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.17. from which the Lord was wont to shew mercy to his people; how willing would you have been to see it, and to make towards it, to have Mercy shewn you from it, there being but one such mercy-seat in all the world? Well, we also have such a mercy-seat the rarest also in all the world, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>The Throne of Grace, Heb.</hi> 4.16. a Seat or Throne, not made as that was of pure gold; but pure love, like <hi>Solomons</hi> chariot <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.20. Again, a seat, not having two cubits and a half for its length, and a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and a half for its breadth, as that, <hi>ibidem;</hi> but of

O my Brethren, Let us be such rare birds, as those are who so are for Christs mercy, as I have shewn. <hi>David,</hi> did count the swallow, and the sparrow happy, for that they could have their Nests so near God's Altar, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.3.

Beloved this my God put into my mind, as I was upon the practice of this duty, in my private devotions, before I had penned the same, and me thought it was exceeding sweet to me, and it did make me even mourn for the delight and joy which I took in it; and therefore I would not by any meanes omit it, but resolved to press it, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly

All Rare things are delightful you know, and so was this rare sitting to Christ's Spouse; for saith she, <hi>I sate under his shadow with great Delight.</hi> Beloved, you know what a delight <hi>Jonah</hi> took in his sitting under the shadow of his booth, and under the shadow of his gourd, <hi>So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd,</hi> Jonah 4.5, 6. Now, if it was such a delight to him, to sit under such a booth; and there under such a gourd which continued but till next morning, <hi>v.</hi> 7. O how delightful must needes this sitting be under the shadow of Christs mercy, which endureth for ever, and neither doth nor can wither away, as <hi>Jonahs</hi> gourd did, and makes infinitely more shadow and delight for our souls than that gourd could make for <hi>Jonahs</hi> head; and will not you sit down under it, and pray to Christ that you may. O go, go my Brethren, and pray heartily that as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32247:50"/>God made that gourd to come over his head, to be a shadow to him, so he will cause his mercy to come over, and for your souls, to be a shadow to them, and a delight to them, and so sit down there-under, as <hi>Jonah</hi> under the shadow of his gourd; and that now presently, being therein also like <hi>Jonah,</hi> which signifieth a Dove, whose tone is <hi>Now,</hi> as you have heard. But hereof more hereafter when I come to the Land of Delight.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon the account of Experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For without this sitting you can have none, so as to say experimentally from it, as the Spouse here said, <hi>I sate under his shadow with great delight.</hi> And as <hi>Isa.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Thou hast been a shadow from the heat.</hi> Without it, my Brethren, the greatest of Scholars, when they have run thorow all sorts of Arts and Scien<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, and have been Peripateticks, and Academicks, I know not how long, yet are but Scepticks, and stand like <hi>Janus</hi> in the field of knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Without it I do not see what you can do in fiery tryals and under grievous persecutions, when a shadow of mercy is more worth than
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32247:51"/>a house full of money. Beloved, do not you see, how in a very hot summer season, when that burning Torch, the Sun I mean, throweth down its flaming beames, like flames of fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men and beasts; beasts do run to shadows, as not being able to endure such fervent throws. Answerably whereunto, I say, souls are not able to suffer such heats, unless they may then meet with such shadow-seats, or sittings, which are to be had under Christ. Christ himself did therefore so joyn himself in company with those three harmless Children in the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. because he knew that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him and his mercy, they would never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfortably to bear and to suffer that grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous burning heat, which was in that fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, whereinto they were cast, it having been heated seven times more than it was wont to be heat, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. And I have
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Theodor. Hist. Eccl. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> read of a very holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, called <hi>Theodorus,</hi> who suffered under <hi>Julian</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate; and being hanged naked upon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, was most grievously whipt with thongs, from morning to night, and so taken down and kept in iron chaines; that when he was let down some did ask him, what pain he felt when he was so cruelly used? and that his answer was, That at first he felt a little pain, but after that one did appear to him, who with a cooling,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32247:51"/>soft linnen cloath did continually wipe his face from the drops of that sweat which appeared upon his face; and that when his Tormentors left off beating of him, it was rather a grief than pleasure to him; because he that so eased him of his pain, during his suffering, did also then depart from him: so that the comforting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Christ, and our sitting under the shadow of it, is absolutely necessary, under grievous suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and persecutions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So without it, how can ye bear Gods wrath? when Christ himself had his conflict with his Fathers wrath, he had need of an Angel to come down from heaven to comfort him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43. &amp; do you think to luctate with the same wrath, without that Angel of the Covenant, Christ himself, with his mercies, to comfort you? What saith the Church, <hi>It is the Lords mercy that we are not consumed; because his compassions fail not, Lam.</hi> 3.22. It is said of <hi>Jonah,</hi> that when the Sun did shine hot upon his head, his gourd, which was such a comfort to him, being gone and withered, he fell into this pittiful pang of discontent, which made him wish in himself to die, and to say, It is better for me to die than to live, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.8. So when this shadow of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is gone, as that of <hi>Jonah's</hi> gourd, and the wrath of God like the burning Sun, shines fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently upon our hearts, as that other Sun upon
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32247:52"/>his head, we will wish rather to die than live; nay, be ready to curse the very day of our birth, as once <hi>Job</hi> 3.3. So that upon this account al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, we cannot want Christs mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And is it possible for ye (think ye) to hold out without it, in so many hard and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting journeys w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> you must make, &amp; labours w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> you must undertake for heaven, &amp; be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? No, no. <hi>Quod caret aiterna requie, durabile non est;</hi> That is, that which wants alternal rest, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be durable. As for example, the painful labourer cannot stand to his work, and do it to an end, unless he sit down sometimes. So the weary Traveller cannot hold out in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to his journeys end, unless he rest between. No more can you go thorow such a world of duties, as lie upon you to be run thorow by you; nor do such a multitude of work, as is to be done of you, unless you sit down now and then under the shadow of Christs grace and mercy; Mercy being the way, by which we go up to God, and do good, as

Yet not I,</hi> saith he, <hi>but the grace of God, which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>And therefore seeing we have this ministry,</hi> which requireth a world of work to be done by us, <hi>as we have obtained mercy we faint not,</hi> 2 Cor.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:32247:52"/>4.1. Mark, we faint not; and how comes this? through mercy, saith he, so that without Christs great mercy, we can never, hold out in duty in that respect; and besides that in another also; in that, as I hinted at it first, your duties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, will not be accepted, that you may be saved; For, <hi>not by works which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, Tit.</hi> 3.5. which caused a holy Writer to say, wo to the laudible life of man, if it be judged without mercy; which is no more than holy <hi>David</hi> said before him. <hi>If thou Lord shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand</hi> (though he be never so holy) <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.3. but then mark, what followeth, <hi>But there is forgiveness with thee, vers.</hi> 4. that is, forgiving mercy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Especially in that weighty duty of praying and praying in faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. For then we take the greatest journey which we have to <hi>undertake,</hi> we go to do the hardest work which we have to <hi>undergo;</hi> we <hi>set</hi> our selves to discharge the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultest of all dutyes, which do <hi>beset</hi> us; we <hi>impose</hi> upon our poor weak shoulders the heaviest of all services which God doth <hi>propose</hi> to be done by us; and unless mercy help us to bear what we take upon us to bear, though we had the shoulders of <hi>Atlas,</hi> we shall never be able to bear it but rather shal be necessitated to forbear; for Mercy must then help, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. Beloved, when a man prayeth as he ought, he accuseth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32247:53"/>himself, arraigneth himself, condemneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.19. And such is his charge wherewith he chargeth his soul, as that he is even ready to sink down under the heavy wrath of God, which he feeleth in his soul, and with the terrours of the Almighty, which like arrowes stick in his heart; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he hath met with many frowns from <hi>Jehovahs</hi> angry countenance, and with much of his indignation, before he betook himself to prayer and supplication; and whenas he is in prayer, God is angry with his very prayet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 80.4. then it goeth hard indeed; and that maketh him cry out in prayer, and to say, <hi>Thy wrath lyeth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah. And, I am afflicted, and ready to dy from my youth; whilest I suffer thy terrours I am distracted; thy fierce wrath goeth over me, thy ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours have cut me off,</hi> Psal. 88.7, 15, 16. So that Mercy, upon this account, is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in prayer especially; insomuch that there is is scarce a prayer made by any gracious soul, which is not fraighted with petitions for mercy, after the most perfect patterns of <hi>Davids</hi> prayers wherein he did so frequently, and fervently cry to God for mercy; as you may see throughout the whole body of his Psalmes; which generally do flow, yea, over-flow like the main sea, with Requests of mercy, so that I may boldly say, that I know not a more usefuller, and needful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:32247:53"/>thing in prayer, than asking of mercy; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that I, for my part, do always desire to spend the greater part of a solemn prayer in petitioning for mercy. Cry mercy, therefore my Brethren, above all things▪ and that in faith, when you speak to God in prayer; as thus, making use of something already mentioned upon another account, and some other besides; Lord, I have read, that when thou didst hang upon the Tree of the Cross, thou didst cry, and say, I thirst, <hi>John.</hi> 19.28. Thirsting after my souls salvation: and as thou didst then thirst after that, so do I now thirst, in this heat, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee the Tree of Life, and the Water of Life, and thy Compassion; O when shall I be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and have this my great thirst quenched? O Now, now. Or thus, Lord, I have read, how thou didst once drown the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the Red Sea, thereby shewing mercy to thy people, which else they would have destroyed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.27. O let my fins now, be like those <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and let them also be drowned in the Red Sea of thy great mercy mingled with thy precious blood, which will make it red indeed; and let both even cover them all, as many as they be, as the great Sea covereth all those infinite sands that are in the bottom of it, according to thy holy Word, which saith, and <hi>Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the Sea,</hi> Micah 7.19. Or thus, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy servant,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32247:54"/>for in thy sight shall no man living be justified;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without mercy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.2. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me,</hi> Psal. 86.16. <hi>And in thy wrath, remember mercy,</hi> Hab. 3.2. Or thus, Lord, I have heard thy servant say, that in comparison of thy great mercy, all my sins are but like a spark of fire to the great Ocean; and therefore now, O my God, have mercy upon me, according to the multitude of thy compassions, and let my great, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and innumerable transgressions, be like a spark to thy great mercy, and let it, even now, forth-with, immediately quench the same, that they be no more seen. Or thus, cry with the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and say, <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David</hi> (who have sinned after the similitude of <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.22. For though I went not properly in unto <hi>Bathshebah,</hi> and did not slay, as he did, <hi>Ʋriah;</hi> yet have I gone in unto the sin of Lust, and Lascivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Wantonness, committed with mine eyes, or speeches, or imaginations; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have slain my brother, with whom I have been rashly angry, and whom I have hated, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. And then go on; and whereas she said, <hi>My daughter is grievously vexed of the Devil, ibidem,</hi> say thou, for else my poor soul will be grievously vexed of the Devil, namely, in hell fire for ever. Again, say, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me, and help me,</hi> vers. 25. And, <hi>Turn me, and I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32247:54"/>shall be turned,</hi> Jer. 31.18. O my God, turn me and make me of thy great mercy to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the tops of <hi>Shenir,</hi> and of <hi>Hermon,</hi> and <hi>Amana,</hi> even from the lusts of my flesh, from the lusts of mine eyes, and from my pride of life, and from all that sinful company which formerly hath been so dear to me, and from all my fierce and Leonine anger, and from all my Leopard-like dissembling, hatred, falshood and hypocrisie, I humbly pray thee. Some haply will blame me for enlarging my self so, in these motives, both for so many sub-divisions, and such repetitions, and large inculcations of some things already and formerly pressed; but I must desire such to attribute it partly to my much enlarged affections, which in the study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this great point, did so carry me out, even beyond my purpose; and partly to a kind of boldness which I took from others, who did the like, as they may see in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Rest, especially in the fourth and fifth motives. And Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> in his Direct. for right comforting afflicted Consciences, <hi>p.</hi> 25.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>In regard of the Life to come.</hi> Some things are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32247:55"/>vallued in one Country, but not in another; as for Example, Gold is much esteemed in our Countrey, but not in another: For there is a
<note n="*" place="margin">Helin.</note> Country, wherein they make so little reckoning of it, as that they make letters and mannacles for prisoners of it. Again in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> dayes, silver was no more made of than stones, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.27. and yet in our days it is enough made of. But the mercy of Christ is, and will be esteemed, not only upon earth, in our Countrey, but also in the Heavenly, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our dayes, but to all eternity with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of dayes. We have a notable place for this; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy on that day;</hi> namely, of Judgment. Mark, mercy will do us pleasure, and be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for us in the very day of Judgement, when Judgement will be kept in righteousness, when righteousness will be extended to all, when all shall come naked and bare before Christs dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Tribunal, to give an account of all that which they have done, when all that which they have done shall come to light. For all things discovered, <hi>are mademanifest by the light, Eph.</hi> 5.13. And when a manifestation of mercy will be more worth, than this whole worlds Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and therefore, O the need which then we shall have of mercy; that we may not, as those which here have shewn no mercy, be judged
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32247:55"/>without mercy; but rather, mercy may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce against judgement, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13. By this you may all conceive, what use there is and will be, after this life is ended, to bring poorsouls to heaven, and how those that are now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven came to heaven; namely, by Christs infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy and merits only. So that if any of us rapt up, like <hi>Paul</hi> into heaven, were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to view all those glorious and crowned Kings, stiled Saints, wearing their several Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems, and Aureolaes, which are in heaven, were allowed to ask every one of them, how he came to heaven, they would all with one consent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer him, and say, as the Apostle, <hi>Not by works of righteousness which we have done: but according to his mercy he saved us,</hi> Tit. 3.5. And, <hi>It is the Lords Mercy that we were not damned.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you desire to be saved, and to sit down with <hi>Ahraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mattb.</hi> 8.11. be perswaded now to sit down under the shadow of the great mercy of Jesus Christ, who is the King of heaven. Or thus let me say unto you, according to that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table saying in the Gospel, to be spoken to one, who being bid to a wedding, sits down in the lowest room, <hi>Friend go up higher, Luke</hi> 14.10. So Friends, sit higher, namely, under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the highest Majesty, for hitherto you sat too where you sate, in that you were too much addicted to, and set upon the things here
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32247:56"/>below, which are too low for your heaven-born spirits, and did not mind at all their sitting down in the kingdome of heaven above, nor that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down under the shadow of Christs sweetest mercy, which befits you better.</p>
            <p>But I desire to come to a final conclusion and period of this most comfortable conclusion.</p>
            <p>Beloved, shall I entreat you now to be ruled? shall I prevail with you after all this? or must more Arguments be used for you to be induced to sit down under the shadow of Christs mercy, besides all those which have been produced? I hope there is no need of it; but that you will be won by so much of Reason as hath been given, to give over resisting, and that from henceforth you will be insisting on the things so fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; that Christs sweetest mercy by every one of you may be recovered; for why should ye stand it out any longer? Have ye never heard many a man say? I am weary with standing, I must sit down? and are not you weary of standing too? Me-thinks you should be, for have ye not stood, and stood it out long enough already? O let me beseech you dear Christians that you will sit down once, and stand no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor stand it out no longer against such clear Convictions, Argumentations, and perswasions used; but this very day wherein you hear his voice in his Ministry, you will yeeld and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the evidence of truth, and demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32247:56"/>on of Gods holy Spirit, and so rest your selves under the shadow of his wings, that you may be able to say truly, this day <hi>I sate down under</hi> the <hi>shadow</hi> of my Saviours mercy <hi>with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi> I will use no more sailes where now I am, to wit, in this Sea of matter▪ being now bound and bent to the Land; I will strike sail, and make toward that Shore where my business mostly lieth, and so get into that Haven of rest which is now before me, there to rest a little while, and afterward I will go ashore, the shore I mean of delight; and the Lord be my good speed, when I shall be there, that I may do well there, whilst I do well there, you trading with me, and I with you, to make you partakers and sharers of that great delight, which is the Merchandise of that pleasant Land; Unto which I pray God now to bring both you and me, to our hearts content. <hi>Amen,</hi> So be it.</p>
            <p>The Third Observation is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is an exceeding great delight to be taken in Christ.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The delight which a gracious soul doth, and we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so may take in Christ, is exceeding, and will be exceeding great.</hi>

            <p>See <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.19. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. For the illustration whereof, I shall propose and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve these <hi>Six</hi> following <hi>Problems.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:32247:57"/>
            <p> The <hi>First</hi> is, <hi>How this delight in strictnesse differs from joy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, <hi>Whether this joy be so great, that it may be called the best among men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is, <hi>Whether we may not take delight in Creatures too?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth, Whether natural delight may not be as great, yea greater?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth, Wherein this great delight consists?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth, Why this delight is so exceeding great?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>First,</hi> I answer; That delight is of a larger Extension than joy, for delight is a
<note n="*" place="margin">Avicen.</note> Genus to joy, which is a Species of it. To the <hi>Second</hi> thus; That this Question had not been moved, if it had not been for
<note n="*" place="margin">Platonici.</note> some who have denyed it, that such a delight may be among men, as may be called best, taking best in the abstract, and delights to be generations, and imperfect motions, which will not hold in intellectuals; so that we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are bold to hold the Affirmative, because that which is best in every thing is the ultimate end, which is God, <hi>pro re,</hi> for the thing, who is the best; and, <hi>pro usu,</hi> or for use. The frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, which cannot be without a delight, so great as that it may well be called the hest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. For what is God? Is he not the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32247:57"/>Ocean of all true consolation, the joy of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mans life, the life of his joy, the strength, the stay, the basis, the spring, the fountain of all his refreshments?</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Third,</hi> I answer; That according to the delight which is called <hi>minor,</hi> or the lesser, we may take delight in Creatures also, as you may see, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.2. but not according to that which is called <hi>major,</hi> or the greater here treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, we neither may nor must, for that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By another Distinction, That there is a delectation which we call a prime, or primary, and a secondary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Primary,</hi> As that which is to be taken in God, and is also reserved for God, so as that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it we may say as Christ, <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, &amp;c.</hi> So, First delight your selves in God, <hi>Matth▪</hi> 6.33.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Fourth,</hi> I answer; No. But simply, and of and in it self spiritual delight is greater than any natural or corporal, though it may be more

                  <hi>Aq.</hi> 1.2. <hi>q.</hi> 31.</note> vehement, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better known to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and accompanied with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32247:58"/>a corporal transmutation: My reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are three things required to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Adjunct, Good.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That whereto it is joyned.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The Conjunction it self.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> But all these are greater in Spiritual delight, than in any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; because a Spiritual good is greater than a Natural, forasmuch, as for it, the other, I mean the Natural, is vilipended. Again, the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive faculty of the Soul is more noble than the sensitive.</p>
            <p>The Conjunction it self, more intimate and inward, because the Intellect doth not onely touch but penetrate all, even with ease; and it is more firme too, because spiritual goods are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and not like corporal, corruptible, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Fifth,</hi> I answer; That this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light consists,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>In much motion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>In much dilatation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Mach Motion.</hi> Every delight is a

                  <hi>Aqu.</hi> 1.2. <hi>q.</hi> 3. <hi>a. Est motus animae.</hi>
               </note> Motion, but not every delight so great a Motion. Motion, you will sav, <hi>How can this be? Doth not Delight bring quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness rather than Motion?</hi> I answer, Yes. And yet there remaines after that an immutation in the Soul, for which it is called a Motion. True
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:32247:58"/>it is, that Motion ceases, according to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of means, when the end is obtained, for which such and such meanes were used; but it ceaseth not according to the intention of the end thereof, because, as we desire what we have not, so we delight in what we have: and do we not experimentally find it so? Is not the whole soul moved, and much moved with delight, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, when it is exceeding great? Doth not the Intellect, or Understanding stand frighted with the superlative, and most pleasant Idea's of purest delight? Doth not the Will bend and bow it self to that, when once true delight is entred? Are not our Affections transported when this delight is imported? On Beloved, did we but behold the inside of that man in whom this great delight is centred, we should see his very heart leap, his spirits dance, his mind change, because of so great a change.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In much dilatation.</hi> For a Saint, being much delighted, doth then much ampliate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his heart, that it may abundantly, sully, perfectly enjoy that highest good, which it is so delighted with; and so this dilatation is nothing else but a motion to this satitude, which it tends to, and which becometh competent to delight, Metaphorically, in two respects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In respect of the apprehensive faculty of the Soul; whereby is apprehended the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:32247:60"/>of that good which is convenient for it, which is its Spiritual perfection and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, according to which the soul is said to be dilated, and magnified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In respect of the affective power of the soul, which doth acquiesce and rest in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable good, which it is delighted with, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inwardly penitrates into, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth so dilate it self, that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and hold the same, and please it self exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively and abundantly thereby. For then, Oh the delectation which there is then perceived when the soul is so dilated! The enlargements which Saints then find in their before straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened spirits, do even infinitely transcend all the blandishments of this present world, being such and so great, as that no tongue can utter them, no pen describe them, no natural heart conceive them.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Sixth</hi> Probleme, I answer; That this delight is so exceeding great.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Because of the rise and spring from which, and with which it cometh.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Because of the rise, from which, and with which it cometh.</hi> For it riseth from so vast and large

               </note> apprehension of the chiefest good, as transcends any ordinary capacity, and ascends up to the highest majesty. Beloved, shall I tell you what is in my mind? when I look upon this rise of this great delight, me-thinks I see an Ocean of all delectables before me; because of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of all that truly good is, which this delight springs from, and which in a manner it containeth; for it followeth, as I told you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the apprehension of the highest good, in which are concentred all delectable and good things that can be imagined. Now what a great, vast, big thing the main Ocean is, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that concavity which contains it, many of us, Marriners especially, do know. Sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly whereunto we may wel conceive also, what a great thing this great delight must be, which comes from such a Sea of delectables to us, and so (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12.) apprehends the great God, who is that great and chiefest good to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by us. Oh it must needs be ineffably great, transcendently great, admirably great. O Souls, consider what I say, and see that you may be even ravished with this great delight, and that great and incomparable good, which it apprehendeth, together with all the desirables with which it cometh, they being such as, <hi>Non
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32247:61"/>possunt reticeri, nec recitari;</hi> that is, may not be concealed, nor recited.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Because of the manner after which it cometh;</hi> for it cometh overwhelmingly, being like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which come so; as you may see; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>So our consolation also aboundeth by Christ, or floweth over,</hi> as the

                  </gap>, Superfluit.</note> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hath it. Beloved, if the Ocean Sea should break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all its banks and bounds, how would it come pouring in with all its waves, and waters, and overwhelm us all! just so doth this great delight, which cometh after such a manner as I have shewn, overflow us, as coming from God with God, and ascending up even over us to God; as all the Rivers in the world run into the Sea, and so return to the place from whence the Rivers come, according to that famous Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.7. Hence I say it is, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is so exceeding great, because it cometh so pouring in upon us and into us, like the great Sea; which caused once a
<note n="*" place="margin">Ephrem.</note> holy man to say when he felt this great delight, and the joy of it. <hi>O my God forbear, for I am not able to bear this joy, it is so exceeding great.</hi> And when

               <hi>Sevenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> the Indian Saint was recovering from sickness, he was heard say, <hi>O my God, do not for pitty so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:32247:61"/>me; If I must still live and have such consolations, take me to Heaven.</hi> This he spake being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with this great delight.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Because of the season in which it usually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth;</hi> as namely in, or after great and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounding tribulations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5. When height of heat, and heaviness of heart do <hi>concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when hell and horror our soules do <hi>enter;</hi> when <hi>scorchings</hi> &amp; <hi>scourgings</hi> of tongues <hi>assail</hi> us, when friends and favourers <hi>fail</hi> us; when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but anguish and affliction is before us, and wrath and woe hang over us; when our Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular dayes, which of all the dayes of the year, are the hottest, are come for us; that is, when our mourning time begins to <hi>commence,</hi> and our singing time is gone <hi>hence;</hi> then, and therefore this delight comes to be so great by the wise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of our great God; because our trouble and tribulation is also great; according to that fore-cited Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5.</p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>Application</hi> of this Grand <hi>Observation.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To begin with a Ʋse of Communication.</hi> Then why do many of us so little care or labour for this great delight? <hi>You will say,</hi> Who doth? <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> Nay, who almost doth not? For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle said once, <hi>Wheras there is among you envying, and strife, and division, are ye not carnall, and walke as men?</hi> 1 Cor. 3.3. So whereas some are for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, others for wine, others for sports, others for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32247:62"/>new invented and strange apparell, others for strange meat, and for the belly, others for all manner of lasciviousness, which they act even with greediness, others for the world, and the profits, riches, revenues and emoluments of it, taking therein so much complacency, as that of them may be said, what <hi>David</hi> spake (<hi>Ps.</hi> 16.2.) of Saints, that in them, that is, such low, base things, is all their delight; are ye not carnall and walk, and live as men, little caring, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for this exceeding great delight? But, why, my Brethen, Why? Is it not,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because you are ignorant of so great a good, as this great delight is, and the things therein contained, and thereby apprehended, as hath been ostended. The God of this world having blinded your eyes, like a Raven which striketh out the poor sheeps eyes, that she may not see the way to escape his tyrrannie. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enough, some of you have in many things else, I know, but in this I dare say, you have so little, especially experimental Knowledge, as that what Christ once spake to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> may be fitly applyed, and spoken to many an old hearer among us, <hi>Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</hi> John. 3.10. So art thou a minister, a professour, a hearer so long, and knowest not these things, namely the things which have been but now spoken of, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32247:62"/>great Delight, and therefore makest so little use of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it not because many of you have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, there is a far greater delight to be taken in the things forementioned, than in Christ? Christ being unseen, and those other things which you take such pleasure in, seen, yea, felt some of them, which causeth this conceit; but I would have you know that you are meerly consened, and deceived. For, how can the delight of such things be possibly greater than this exceeding great delight, which I here preach up, sith the delectables, which this great Delight appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth, are incorruptible, as I told you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and undeceiving; but the delectables which your Delight apprehendeth, both corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and deceivable altogether, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. For Ioe, your delight for the present maketh a goodly, fair, gorgeous shew; but when it cometh to handling it is nothing but a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when it, to true light, is nothing but a shadow; when it cometh to weight, nothing but smoak; when it cometh to opening it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an image of plaister-work full of old rags, and patches within.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not because of the worlds strong and and powerful enticements (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.1.) allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ill Counsels, which are stronger than our good, and prove too hard for you, and will deceive you at last; as you may see in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:32247:63"/>2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. Beloved, the world hath a thousand cunning fishers, to lay before you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant baits, but all furnished with dangerous hookes within; it hath infinite strumpets of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> to offer you drink in golden Cups, full of sensual delights, but all mingled with most deadly poyson; it hath in every door an aluring <hi>Jael</hi> to intice you in to the milk of sinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; but all have their hammers and nailes in their hands to murder you, when they have lulled you asleep; and you are so simple as to yield to her rather than to us; to affect her <hi>lies,</hi> rather, wherein her strength <hi>lyes,</hi> than truth and reality for your eternall safety; to elect her delights rather, though it be to your Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than this great Delight, which we stand for, though it be for your eternall salvation. On folly! O madness!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it not because you are so unwilling to take <hi>paines,</hi> for the greatest and truest <hi>gaines,</hi> and so consequently for this great Delight, which by no means can be had &amp; obtained, unless it be with all our might; for is not operation, at least in part, the cause of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; so that famous
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristot.</hi> 2. <hi>Ethie. cap.</hi> 2.</note> Writer, Delight is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural operation, without let. O sirs, you are loath to be doing, as some are, for this great, and glorious Delight; you love your ease, your beds, your boards, your
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32247:63"/>lazy life too well, and that, together with these other Causes of your not caring for this great Delight, is, or will at last be your undoing; nay, hath it not spoiled you already? For, oh what a deal of sweetest content, and soul-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing pleasures, you lo se and <hi>forgo,</hi> letting <hi>go</hi> this great Delight! there being no sense, nor reason for it at all, why Christ should cast away his sweetest love, upon such as cast away him; should bestow his heavenly solaces upon them which bestow so much needless time, upon pride &amp; vanity, dressing themselves before their Glasses; should give himself to them, who give themselves to nothing but sensuall delights, which they pursue with all their might; should poure out those high, and heavenly things, which this great delight apprehendeth, upon such as poure in so muchstrong drink, with such unsatiableness, which he detesteth; and inebriate themselves with so much sinful pleasure as this vile, vaine world affordeth. No, No, he will not, he will not: He knoweth better what to do with those precious things, than to throw them away upon you, who do so dote upon those pernicious things; and therefore, Why will ye do so?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let this serve for our Excitation, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this delight, and to take it because it is so exceeding great; where give me leave to leave with you Directions of two sorts.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:32247:64"/> 1. <hi>Directions shewing what meanes we must use to get it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Directions shewing how you and I must take it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the first sort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If any of you were not yet espoused to Christ, you must labour to be,</hi> that with this spouse, whose words these are, you may then be able so to take it as she did. There is no doubt then to be made of it; For what spouse is there, which (having a Bridegroom alive which she dearly loves) is not delighted in him, and with him. Hence new married people, especially, have their great Delights; so have men and women newly desponsated to Christ, theirs in Christ, Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graciously pleased to give his loves to them, who so newly have given their troth to him; as you may see what joy, and delight those new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born babes, and newly married Christians had, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Question.</hi> Thou wilt say, But will Christ have me, if I would have him?</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>He will.</hi> O that you could make that good! What if I bring his own written word for it? Let me see it. Read what is here written <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever.</hi> Will you now believe me? I am almost perswaded to it: but there are two things which do mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discourage me: which be they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because I doubt whether he mean me, when he saith, <hi>I will betroth thee. Answ.</hi> If
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32247:64"/>thou canst but believe, he meaneth thee also; for the <hi>promises were made to Abraham and his seed, not seeds, but seed, which is Christ, Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now to Abraham and his seed, were the promises made: He saith not, and to seeds, as of many, but as of one; and thy seed, which is Christ:</hi> And so consequently to all such as believe in Christ; for they and Christ are all one; and they also are <hi>Abrahams</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nay, that very word <hi>Thee,</hi> maketh exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for thee; for what was that people which the Lord spake to, when he said, <hi>I will betroth thee?</hi> Reflect upon <hi>Hosea.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.2. and you will find it to be a people addicted to whoredoms, &amp; adulteries, which it had perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated and committed; yet, <hi>I will betroth thee,</hi> saith the Lord; whereupon it followeth, that if the Lord could find it in his heart to love such a people, and marry it, he may love and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thee also, nay, will, if thou canst believe him, though thou hast been a lewd man, or woman, a very harlot, an odious drunkard, a covetous wretch, a person ingulphed in sinful delights, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated in sensual pleasures. See farther what is written, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6, 8. <hi>And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thine own blood.</hi> Mark, the same thing is spoken twice, that we may take speciall notice of it, and believe God in it; <hi>yea, I said unto thee;</hi> Note, again it is repeated, <hi>I
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32247:65"/>said unto thee;</hi> For else, who would believe it, if the Lord had not said it; therefore he doubles it, <hi>when thou wast in thy blood;</hi> this is now spoken the 3d time, &amp; yet no vain repetion, but a most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affirmation, that by such a three-fold cord, which is not casily broken, the most free God, might be as it were tied, and bound to stand to what he hath spoken; and what was it, think ye? Oh, it was, that honey-sweet word <hi>LIVE.</hi> Oh saith the poore trembling, sinful, wrathful, adulterous, covetous soul of man, I shall surely dye. No, saith God, <hi>thou shalt live:</hi> and why Lord? to that the Lord answers, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>And when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, thy time was the time of love;</hi> as if he should say, and that which moved, and made me to say <hi>LIVE</hi> was <hi>LOVE.</hi> O sweet love, Canst thou love then such a poor wretch as I am? say thou that hearest me this day, and madest but now a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of it; I see thou canst, nay I see thou say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that thou wilt, and therefore why should not I believe thee? O <hi>I Believe, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief,</hi> Mark. 9.24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Quest.</hi> But what is the second thing which doth discourage thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Because I fear, I shall not be true, and faithful to him; if I should go near so far, as to be in the mind to marry him, and that he will not therefore have me, because he knoweth so much by me, even as he knoweth what hath

See also <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. And besides, when he betroths us to himself, he doth it in Righteousness, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.19. that is, he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on us the
<note n="*" place="margin">Jun. &amp; Trem. in Loc.</note> gifts of Righteousnes, that we may work righteousness, and not live in unrighteousness; whence it comes to pass, that though sin be in us, yet we be not in sin, that is, do not allow our selves in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny known reigning sin, because we then know the Lord, when by marriage we are made one with the Lord, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.20. and so consequently dare not continue in sin against the Knowledge of the Lord; and therefore, tell me now, O Dear soul, whether thou be not onely almost, but even altogether perswaded to be married to the Lord? If thou be, then say so, as <hi>Rebeck a</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:32247:66"/>once, when she would go with <hi>Eleazar</hi> to <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> said, <hi>I will go, Gen.</hi> 24.58. so say thou, I will go, and go to be married forthwith to Jesus Christ, that heavenly <hi>Isaac,</hi> who hath sent his servant to me this day, to move this matter of marriage to me; Oh blessed be the day, whereon such a blessed motion was made, and blessed be the messenger, who was sent with such a message for me. O sweet Jesus, I am coming, I am coming to thee, though it be somewhat late and long first, to take thee by the hand of Faith, for my most loving, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-living Husband. O, my dear, take me, oh take me, and let me be thine, and become thou mine, that I may say with thy Spouse, which is thy Love and thy Dear, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> Cant. 2.16. Is it done, O dear soul? I hope it is; if not, then O my God, do thou work both to will and to do in this, and in all other soules that hear or read these words, that thy Son may become their Saviour, their Lord, and their most loving Husband this day, and to all eternity, I humbly beseech thee.</p>
            <p>I fear that I have been too long upon this subject, but there was reason for it, because it is the principal thing here to be done; as without which no good can be done to any purpose, to any, or by any of you, till this be done. All things else to be spoken hereafter about meanes to be used for the gaining of that great delight
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32247:66"/>which you are to get, are but appendices to this. This is foundation matter, as tending to the gaining of faith, without which no flesh can be either saved, or truly delighted; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope you will easily, and willingly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me; for the future I promise to be breifer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be grieved much.</hi> Strange! Are not these two, grief and delight contraries?</p>
            <p>I answer, <hi>Yes.</hi> Yet may grief beget delight <hi>per accidens,</hi> that is, by accident, and that both as it is in acting, and as it is in remembring.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In acting, so it causes a remembring of the delectable and diligible good, about whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension we are delighted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In remembring, so it causes delight, in that we remember how we escaped, and were delivered; whence it is, that sometime we are said to weep for joy. Agreeable whereto is also that of blessed <hi>Austin, With

And what think ye of those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs which so rejoyced in God, and were so delighted with God? Did not their great joy and delightfulness in God spring up from their foregoing heaviness, and from their grievous sufferings, which they underwent for God. Let us hear some of their triumphant passages. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Sanders,</hi> that blessed Martyr, used these
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32247:67"/>words before he died, <hi>I am merry, and I trust shall be merry maugre all the Devils in hell.</hi> And Master <hi>Aimund</hi> burnt in <hi>France,</hi> after his examination was so full of joy &amp; comfort, as that he did try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with the Apostle, saying, <hi>Who shall separate me from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8.35, 36, 37, 38, 39. Beloved how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant is this to that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>Wherein you greatly rejoyce, though now, if need be, you are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness.</hi> And therefore O blessed teats. O teares to be desired; For, from such tears spring joys, from joyes assurances, from assurances delights, even delights unutterable, incomparable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelable. O sirs, set open therefore, set wide open your sluces, your eyes I mean, and let tivers of tears run down over your cheeks, that Christ may delight your hearts.</p>
            <p>More Particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would have you grieve then especially, and first, when you go about that marriage, which I but now motioned to you, and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among you, for then it is most seasonable, as you may see, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. according to <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. and when you do grieve at such a time, grieve and weep most of all for this, that Jesus Christ that dearest Saviour, hath been so much abased and abused, refused and rejected by you, in that you have so long stood it out against him, and would not have him, when he would have you and even woeth you, as a man woeth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32247:67"/>a woman, again and again, day by day, and Sabbath after Sabbath, to win your good will; and so consequently, for that you have so long wanted and been without so loving and precious an husband, who so loved you, as that he gave himself for you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. For this purpose is that notable saying, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his onely Son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for his first-born.</hi> O sirs, do but hearken to me in this, and do this, and I assure you by the never-failing word of God, formerly alledged out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.1. that it will not be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith will <hi>come,</hi> and Christ, by faith, will <hi>become</hi> your most dear and everlasting Husband, to oblect, and to delight, fill and feast your most heavy and sadded hearts for a season, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable consolation; according to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Scripture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold, I will send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me;</hi> which is done, when we are brought to a due, and deep humiliation, and to weeping and mourning for Christ: and then, mark what comes after; <hi>The Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come, even the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I advise you, that after you are espoused to Christ, yet you grieve and mourn, as often as you may; like <hi>Sampsons</hi> weeping Spouse, which mourned and wept, and bedewed her cheeks
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32247:68"/>with teares all the time, during which her wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the dayes of feasting lasted, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.17. So be you Christs weeping Spouses, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now for one thing, then for another, and more especially in praying, and meditating for sin, and for the want of Christ, and want of Grace, and want of Assurance, I mean the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of Gods favour, pardon of sin, and your future felicity and salvation, which you expect to an endless duration; for then commonly (I for my part do find it so) cometh that joy which I mentioned when I spake of weeping for joy; as it is written, <hi>They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy,</hi> Psal. 124.6. O sweet weeping! Oh how Saints therefore do prize those precious things, which we call tears; I mean such tears! Oh how they look upon them as so many pearles in their eyes, and falling from their eyes! Oh that my head were full of them, even a fountain of them! mine eyes full of them, my cheeks full of them! Or thus, <hi>O that my head were waters</hi> (as <hi>Jeremy</hi> wished once, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.1.) <hi>and mine eyes a fountain of teares, that I might weep day and night</hi> for my sins, and my wants, and my weakness, and my having so long lived in the tents of <hi>Meshech,</hi> without Christ, without this great delight, which cometh by Christ; but hereof more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, for I am bent to press this mourning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, as occasions shall present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, because it is a chief thing.</p>

When you were in a greivous Conflict with Satan, and Christ helped you, and delivered you out of the mouth, of that roaring devouring Lion; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his Fathers Lamb, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34, 35. when you were in a Wilderness with <hi>David</hi> and his men, that is, in <hi>want, wanting</hi> the presence of your best beloved, and wanting the <hi>sight,</hi> and <hi>light</hi> of his Face, and wanting Assurance, even the assurance of his love, and of the pardon of sin, and of your everlasting bliss; and he came to you as <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> with bottles of wine, clusters of raisins, and cakes of figs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.18, 19. to refresh him, and his wearied men therewith; that is, with his flagons of sweetest wine, spoken of <hi>Can.</hi> 2.5. with Cordials made, I will not say of figs and raisins, like hers,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32247:70"/>but of amber, and pearles, to wit, himself, who is that pearle of great price, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.45, 46. And of his precious blood, which is like Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergreese, nay better, and better than all her raisins, and figs, and bottles of wine; because they refreshed your very souls, when he spake to you, and said, Loe, here I am, to comfort your hearts; and loe my precious blood, to wash, and to cleanse your souls, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. when you were in an agony, being tossed about your Election, whether ye be predestinated, or no, it may be all night; and about the forgiveness of your sinnes, as doubting whether God would forgive them; and he come the next Morning (as it was my case once, blessed be his holy Name for it, Now, and for ever, O for ever) and so spake to you, or to thee, that readest these words in particular, <hi>My son, be of good chear, thy sinnes be forgiven thee,</hi> Matth. 9.2. And, <hi>Loe, thy name is written in the book of life.</hi> When thou wast in a most servent heat, being set on fire, as it were, by the hot burning wrath of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenging.

(which also was my most sad condition once, in so much as that I felt, methought, even a sensible burning heat in my very tongue) he came and spake to thee so comfortably, as that thou wast able to eccho forth the same words which we read in <hi>Isa.</hi> 12.1. <hi>O Lord, I will praise

So, I will earnestly remember him still; namely, God all-gracious, God all-merciful, full of all pity, full of compassion; and I will remember also his gracious dealings with me still.

Let a man fare, like <hi>Dives,</hi> deliciously every day, let him feed, like the <hi>Israelites,</hi> upon Manna and Quailes; let him apparrel himself in cloth of gold; nay, let him go to a higher strain, let him strain himself much to pervolve and to read the sacred leaves of the Book of Life much; let him ply the Throne of Grace with praying much, yet if he believe not in Christ, what delight can he take in Christ? Christ being resolved to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his mercy and merits to no man living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he lay hold on him by believing, and live by his faith in his Name.

O my God, help this people, and help me also to live such a life. O Lord of life, put life therefore in this word of thine, and in them, and in me, that we may live to see, and to enjoy that great delight.</p>

                  </item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Action is added, because a man is not to live above himself by extasie and transportation, and under himself in conversation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> of these three is, <hi>in splendore,</hi> or brightness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second, In calore,</hi> or heat and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third, In labore,</hi> or labour and painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>In this Extasie the primitive Saints had such complacency for the most part, as that it was said then; Never was Saint but had Extasie. For they did
<note n="*" place="margin">Legatur Theodor. de vitis Patrum. Inprimis, de Simeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Prisco.</note> even labour, by a liquefaction of their soules into God, to espouse themselves to God so, as to put themselves out of the natural deportment of the body, and to live on divine Extasie, without liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were in the body: Nay, some so lived as that it was doubted whether they were living men dead, or dead men living; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder that their delight in God was so exceeding great. Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> calls God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to it, saying, <hi>Testor Deum,</hi> I call God to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:32247:77"/>record, that after many weeks fasting, it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that I was among the very Angels themselves: and what a delight that was, I leave to your consideration. O Souls, if then you would have great delights, nay, live in delights, then live much in extasie, and by ir grow into a far greater, and more familiar acquaintance with God, living more than ever yet ye did with him, to him, in him; being, as it were, severed from the body, sequestred from the world, and taken up into glory. But hereof I shall have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion to speak hereafter yet more, when I shall come to speak of Contemplation, and of our Conversation to be in Heaven. The God of Heaven bless that in the mean to ye, which hath been said of Extasie, that ye may be all for it, and great may be your delight which you may gain by it. <hi>Amen, So be it.</hi>

Or into the Field, as <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> 24. or, if rain hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you, into a Chamber, and there walk with him, as a friend with his friend, and a Bride with her Bridegroom. Or thus, walk with him as <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> 5.22. Taking him by the hand, the hand, I mean, of faith; and saying to him as his dear spouse once, <hi>Come my Beloved, let us go forth into the field,</hi> &amp;c. Cant. 7.11. Concerning which place, and kind of walking, you may see what I have written in a peculiar Treatise, called, <hi>Christ &amp; his Saints spending their time together day and night:</hi> So that I shall say the less of it here; only this I will adde now: and having so intreated, and invited him to go with you, walk with him arme in arme, hand in hand, side by

Out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 52.11. <hi>And I will walk in them.</hi> Oh sweet walking! O walking for Delight! O walking to be admired! for, is there any such walking in the world like this? You would count it a great matter, and high honour, if any of you might be so much in favour with a great and mighty King, as to be admitted by him to walk with him; but what would that be to this! this beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, goeth beyond it; for what an honour is this, for a poor nothing Creature, to walk with its Creator! a poor vile worm with its Makerla man with God! who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.16. and yet such honour have (or may have) all his Saints. O Saints, that I may come with a new supply: walk then, O walk so with that highest Majesty whilest ye may: Nay, go and walk with him, as once <hi>Abraham</hi> did walk with those three men, or rather with the whole most sacred, &amp; ever to be adored Trinity, appearing in the shape of three men, towards <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18.16. so do you walk with him: nay, as he with the same most glorious and ever-honoured Trinity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> for thither I suppose ye are bent: Are not you, O my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? What a glorious and wonderfull walk
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:32247:79"/>was that, when Father <hi>Abraham</hi> so walked with the Father of Mercies; when a son of man, so walked with the Son of God; when flesh and blood, so walked with that holy Spirit! O do ye not wish that it had been your lot to have lived then, and that ye might have walked so with them! Well, though you could not be so happy <hi>as to walk</hi> like <hi>Abraham,</hi> and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in their company then, yet know for certain, that if ye will not be wanting to your selves, you may walk with them now, though not under the same or like Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on visibly, as with three men, yet invisibly as three glorious, and ever blessed Persons, you personating Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his foot-steps, by believing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, up, and be going, oh going along with those, I will not say, Men, but persons, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, O for heaven, and the blessing of God go with you. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Talking with him;</hi> for oh the Delight which also we may take, in and by talking!

Oh yes. <hi>This is my freind,</hi> sayes his dear Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.16. And is he not, if we be Saints, our best Beloved also? yes verily, for so he is called, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32247:80"/>And therefore, look as friend talketh with friend, a Bride with her Beloved, so let us talk with him. <hi>You will say.</hi> What shall we talk? I <hi>Answer.</hi> Here I have much to say, but you are not able to bear it now; and therefore I will say no more but this, you may talk with him about any thing you need; but my advice here, and now is, that you will talk with him especially about his kisses, as his doar spouse, saying, <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his mouth; F<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Oh these loves, they must needs delight us with their sweetness, and even extatize us with their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venliness; they are so exceeding pleasant, and and so transcendently ravishing; for his very mouth, wherewith he kisses his, how sweet it is! <hi>His Mouth is most sweet,</hi> nay, <hi>sweetness it self,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it, saith his dear spouse, <hi>Can.</hi> 5.16. And therefore, if you would take delight <hi>in him,</hi> beg to be kissed <hi>by him.</hi> O Dear saints, what a sweet life might you live, if you would but be more for this Kissing, and for this love, and spend more of your time, in talking with him. Oh! you do not know what a Delight you do <hi>forgo;</hi> neglecting, and forb<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aring to <hi>go</hi> to him more than you are wont by this kind of Talking, which also is praying. Beloved, I pray you, think on it what a happiness, and honour it is, for and to such poor worms as we are, that we can so by praying, and talking, go to case
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32247:80"/>our hearts, and make them <hi>light,</hi> by a bold ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to that Unapproachable <hi>Light;</hi> can even poure out our petitions to that all-powerful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; can make our Request known to him, who is stiled, in regard of some which are aliens and strangers to him, and know him not, <hi>The Ʋnknown God,</hi> Acts 17.23. Can draw near to the Throne of Grace for Grace, when we need it, to serve that all-gracious Deity; can walk and talk when we please, about pleasures to be had now and hereafter for evermore, with that ever blessed, &amp; by our poor prayers much to be pleased Trinity; Can go also to apprehend as much as possibly, of that incomprehensible enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And therefore, O sirs, as <hi>Abraham</hi> once talked with those 3 men, that is, as I told you, with the sacred Trinity in the shape of Men, as he walked with the same toward <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18.16. So do you talk with Christ, yea, with the whole most sacred Trinity, as you are walking with the same for heaven, saying, (For I said but now; that you may talk of any thing ye need) <hi>O Blessed Trinity, as Abraham thy servant, talking with thee, prayed, and interceded for Sodom, so do I now, pray for such and such</hi> (name them) <hi>and for my self also; O my God do not destroy the Just with the Ʋnjust;</hi> do not destroy that which thou hast made, by that which thou hast not made; Do not make us like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> in thy fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indignation; Do not give us up like those
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:32247:81"/>filthy Cities, to fire and brimstone, therein to burn for ever; but rather, as <hi>Abraham</hi> brought thee, O ever-glorious Trinity, on in the way toward <hi>Sodom,</hi> so shew us the way to heaven, and bring us on in that we may not misse; For Oh how many by-wayes are there which lead amiss, and make many miss? and how many are there now that say, <hi>here is Christ, and there is Christ,</hi> Math. 24.23. This is the way, and that is the way, when no such matter? O Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, thou art the way, the way to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; O bring me into thy sacred self, and by thy self to heaven; O with what pleasantness might we thus talk with God, talk with Christ! talk so therefore, O Dear Saints, with Christ, that great may be your Delight in Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Looking.</hi> For, O the delight which the eye takes in seeing, if it see a beautifull person, or thing! How <hi>Jacob</hi> was taken with the sight of <hi>Rachels</hi> beauty, <hi>Sichem</hi> with <hi>Dinahs, David</hi> with <hi>Bathsheba's, Potiphars</hi> wife with <hi>Josephs!</hi> and shall not we take Delight in Christs, and be taken with it, and him, when we see him, think ye? O yes; For, did not <hi>Abraham</hi> when he saw his day, <hi>John.</hi> 8.56. and vvas glad? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look upon him, to take delight in him. We have divers Scriptures for it, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Behold King Solomon,</hi> namely, Christ, the heavenly <hi>Solomon:</hi> and <hi>look upon me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.22. and <hi>looking upon Jesus,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:32247:81"/>saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. Go forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O ye Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and behold Christ, look upon him, and behold his most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable beauty, for <hi>He is fairer than all men, Psal.</hi> 45.2. Even as a Bride taketh an Extraordinary great Delight in looking upon her Beloved and sometimes, even therefore talketh with him, that she may look on him, and behold his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if he be of a beautiful Countenance; so do you Bride-like, look in the face of Christ, your best beloved, to be delighted vvith Christ; and imagine, as you look tovvards him, as if you did see, besides the beauty of his Deity, his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eyes, vvhich are like tvvo suns shining in their strength; or, like the eyes of doves by the Rivers of vvaters, vvashen and fitly set; his cheeks vvhich are like Roses, vvhite, and rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or a bed of spices, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.13. his mouth, vvhich is as svveet as honey, yea svveetness it self, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.16. according to the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> his lips vvhich are like lillies; his hands vvhich are like Gold rings, set vvith the Berill; his legs which are like pillars of marble, set on sockets of fine Gold, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

            <p>
               <hi>You will say,</hi> Sir, you vvould have us thus to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:32247:82"/>look upon Christ, and to behold his beauty, and to take extraordinary delight in it; but what if we do what we may, we either cannot see him, or can see no such beauty in him, as it is written, <hi>When we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him, Isa.</hi> 53.2. What shall we do in such a case?</p>
            <p>I answer, Four wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The cause of it may be in your Eyes, for they may be held that you cannot see him, as those Disciples eyes were, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.16. Which if it be, you must pray Christ that your Eyes may be opened, as theirs were, by Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The cause of it may be in himself. Some of the Jewish
<note n="*" place="margin">Rabbi Josue, Ben Levi, in Thalmud. Tract. Sanhed. cap. helec.</note> Rabbies have a conceit, and write that the Messias is come, but hideth himself for a time for our sins in the Sea, and other Desart places, which though it be false in their sence, yet may be found true in another. For Christ, the Messias of the world may, and sometimes doth <hi>hide himself behind our wall, Cant.</hi> 2.9. that is, the partition wall of
<note n="*" place="margin">Bernard.</note> sin, and that for our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul lives, and because he looketh to be importuned
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:32247:82"/>to shew himself, as in another case, he looketh to be sought unto, to give us new and tender hearts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. Which if it be so, ye must cry to him as <hi>Moses,</hi> every one of you that put forth this case; <hi>Lord, shew me thy glory, Exod.</hi> 33.18. And, <hi>Lord, shew me thy face,</hi> and shew me the light of thy countenance, that therein I may delight my self, and rejoyce more than they, whose Corn, and Wine, and Oyl encreaseth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be, some of you have no Faith; <hi>For all men have not faith,</hi> saith the Apostle, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.2. Which if it be, no wonder that ye cannot see him; for by Faith we see him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> saw him and his day, before he was born, and rejoyced (<hi>John</hi> 8.56.) as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So that you must make out for Faith in the manner aforesaid, crying especially to God for it, that by Faith you may see him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with faithful <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. You may see him in his works, if you cannot see him otherwise, for he hath not left himself invisible to the weak-sighted among men, as you may see, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it to them: For the invisible things of him from the Creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made, even

O Saints, this is sweet sitting indeed; can ye desire any better? Nay, Is there any better than this, in Christ, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? O heaven, heaven, how doth my soul long to be in thee! O when shall it once be that I shall be fully in thee! When?

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:32247:85"/>whereby we come to sit in those places in Christ; for <hi>Rapture</hi> is the highest degree of Contemplation, which causeth in man towering thoughts, irradiateth his soul with high appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, and elevates him to God, taking him out of himself, to live above himself; the soul being thus attracted by divine love, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complieth, and slideth after those attracts; and then, Oh the delight it taketh in this rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Will taking pleasure, to perceive the Understanding, which is the Souls King; taken into rapture with it self, and the Faculties both of Will and Understanding, enter communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ravishments.

For is not Heaven a Garden like that of <hi>Adonis,</hi> nay exceeding it infinitely, nay, a very Paradise for delights? and therefore as <hi>Peter</hi> once said to Christ, when being upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> he was transfigured, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talking with him,

               <hi>Lord, it is good for us to be here; If thou wilt, let us make three Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</hi> So let a Saint, who hath begun to sit down in those heavenly places, say to his soul, Soul it is good for us to be here indeed; let us build Tabernacles here, and abide here. O beloved, had ye lived in the dayes of Christ, had you been upon the holy mount with Christ, had you seen him shine so as he did, had you seen <hi>Moses</hi> also, and <hi>Elias</hi> with him talking with him, what a delight would it have been unto you to see such a glorious sight? and what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire would you have had alwayes to have been there!

Well, that is past, and Christ is to be seen so here upon earth no more, nor <hi>Moses,</hi> nor <hi>Elias;</hi> but in those heavenly places which I spake of, you may see as it were with an eye of Contemplation, both him and them, and that with unspeakable delectation, if you will but follow my counsel, so much tending to your super-abounding consolation: and should not you be heartily willing, vehemently willing, not only to be with Christ there, but also to

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:32247:87"/>the world, sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb, as coming from such a Feast-maker, such a Fountain, such a tree, as Christ is, our best beloved.

            <p>
               <hi>O sirs,</hi> Will you taste now, what is so provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for you; I say, Taste, for I promise and proffer you but a Taste. Fulness is reserved for Heaven, where we shall feed and be filled, eat our meat there ordained, and be satisfied; <hi>fare</hi> deliciously, without <hi>fear,</hi> without want; <hi>take</hi> as much as we will, and not <hi>mistake;</hi> fare well, drink well, do well, even abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and not die. In the mean time, as sometime the Angel of the Lord said to <hi>Eliah,</hi> where he lay asleep under a <hi>juniper</hi> Tree, having brought him a Cake, baked on the Coales, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:32247:87"/>a cruse of water, <hi>Eat and drink, for the journey is too great for thee,</hi> 1 King. 19.6, 7. so let me, who have now brought such provision with me, say to you, who have layn asleep under your juniper Trees of sensual Delights and pleasures, or sate asleep, it may be, in your Pues, when the Word of Life was preached, published, and divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and asleep in your most sad, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Conditions; Arise and eat, arise and take, and taste, what is here provided, for you have a great journey yet to go, from <hi>Sodom</hi> to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> from Satan to God, from Darkness to Light, from one degree of grace to another, from one delight to another, from one mode to another, from Earth to Heaven, where now I leave you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Humbly;</hi> you must take Delight in Christ. This I add and subjoyn, because I fear lest when you shall so talk, so walk, so sit with Christ, &amp;c. you grow and be proud upon so great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; therefore I shall by this Directive, labour to keep you down. Beloved, how humble was Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he so talked and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Father of Spirits, as I would have you do, <hi>saying,</hi> the same time, <hi>That he was but dust and ashes, Gen.</hi> 18.27. I pray you say so too, yea and think so too. Dust is but a little, little thing, so Ashes, and so must ye be, even little little in your own eyes, yea, nothing; for, <hi>such hath God chosen, even things which are not,</hi> poor, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32247:88"/>Creatures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.28. and such we must come to be, if we would take, as we ought, in Christ, that so much hitherto-pressed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hastily.</hi> We have a Proverb in Latine, <hi>Qui eito dat, bis dat,</hi> He that gives quickly, gives twise; and so we may say likewise, he that doth a good thing quickly doth it twise, I adde and twise more easily than he who delayeth the doing of it. Even as when Iron is taken fire hot to be wrought upon, and wax when it is hot to be sealed upon, so I would not have ye to deferre the doing of this great and glorious work as ye were wont, but to take it in hand whilest the iron is hot, and the wax hot, that is, whilest your hearts, which are like both, are hot and warm, yea burn within you, as those Disciples hearts, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. And so may the more easily be wrought upon. O my Brethren, are not your hearts now burning, as it were? May not you say now, as those same Disciples, <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?</hi> Luke 24.32. So, did not our hearts burn within us also whilest this man spake to us this day, so of those Ravishing delights which are to be taken in Christ, and opened the Scriptures, which spake of them unto us, as did Christ? And will not you take this great Advantage
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:32247:88"/>then, and work upon them now while you may, they being so capable of receiving the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of that holy, and soul-warming word of life, which, with so much life, I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach to, and to press upon your preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous souls! O souls, what say you? shall it be so? Will you do so? O let it be so for the Lords sake. I have read of one, that having tasted once the sweetness of a Sanctified imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he said, that if he had known the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a prison before, he would not have stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of it so long as he did, but have been in before that time. And so let every soul that hears or reads these words say, If I had known the sweetness of those delights, as now I know them, having heard so much of them, I would not have abstained from them so long as I did, but would have partaked of them, long before now: and so consequently, O my Brethren, to day, this day wherein you hear or read these things (Remember the day of the moneth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all dayes of the year, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.7.) harden not your hearts, as you have done; but enter, I will not say a Prison, but a Paradise of desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, of delectables, of delicates unutterable, unmatchable, incomparable, that Paradise, I mean, which hitherto I have shewn you; and the Lord be with you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Quietly.</hi> As when we commune with our
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:32247:89"/>own hearts, upon other great and weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which concern the salvation of our soules, <hi>we are to be still, Psal.</hi> 4.4. So, when we set our selves, to delight our selves in Christ, after a solemn manner, let us be still; that is, let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then trouble us, or hinder us, but let us be as free, as solitary, as retired, as possibly we can be, for quietness it self is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable. And it is

And so it should be with us, when we go about this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table work, of bringing forth this glorious work of delighting our selves in the Lord: The world, and worldly cares &amp; affaires, must then be far away from us, that the same may not like windes and waves overwhelm us, and all perturbations of mind must be eliminated by us; and if they will not be gone, nor so leave us, and our own hearts hold with them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come troublesome to us, we must check them for it, and bid them to be quiet, saying to them, as <hi>David</hi> to his, <hi>Why art thou so disquieted withinme? hope in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the help of my Countenance, and my God, Psal.</hi> 43.5.</p>

For of whom a man is overcome</hi> (as they are of their lusts) <hi>of the same is he brought in bondage,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19.

So, you also will go to Christ, and acquaint him with your Condition, saying, Lord, I have been dead, loe these four days, or thus long,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:32247:92"/>and therefore could no more delight my self in thee, than a dead man, in the greatest dainties set before him; and therefore, O most mighty Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, raise me from the dead also as thou rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst <hi>Lazarus</hi> thy Friend. O great friend of poor sinners, who desire to be raised, suscitate me a poor sinner, that I may live, and live in those great delights which are to be taken in thee. O my God, let the same power whereby thou wast raised from the dead thy self, be shewn in me, and for me, that thereby I may come to believe in thee, and so may be quickned by thee, as to sit in heavenly places in thee, I humbly pray thee.</p>

                     <hi>The needfulness thereof;</hi> for God commands it. Where? <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.4. <hi>Delight thy self also in the Lord.</hi> Loe, an express, and explicite Precept; so that I may say unto you, as the Holy Apostle
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:32247:96"/>to the <hi>Athenians, The times of this ignorance, God winked at, but now commands all men every where to repent,</hi> Acts. 17.30. So the times of this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that you were ignorant of the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of this great Delight, to be taken in the Lord, God winked at; but now, seeing you knowit, he commands you all to repent of your past neglect of it, and for the time to come, to delight your selves in him, as here you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by him. And, I say to you moreover, when a King of the earth causeth a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made, concerning a thing which he would have done, though it be but a petty thing you hold your selves bound to do it, and you will do it, as near as you can. And are not you bound now, nay, much more bound, think ye, by this Proclamation also, which the great King of heaven hath made this day, by his servant <hi>David?</hi> Read the Proclamation, in the fore-alleadged, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. to do what he there commands you to do, as namely, <hi>to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light your selves in the Lord,</hi> as you are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord, which is no petty thing neither but so great, and so glorious, as that there can hardly be a greater, or more glorious to be done by us; as you will understand more of it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Beloved, You are not therefore free, to do this thing, or no, but firmly bound; not left to your own choyce, but linkt and chained to the doing of it, by the Prophets voice; not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32247:96"/>to omit any part or peice contained in the said Proclamation, but straightly charged, and obliged by it, wholly and fully to be for this great Delectation. And therefore, I do even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you, by vertue of a warrant which I have in my hand; to wit, this 4<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>verse,</hi> of this 37 <hi>Psalm,</hi> which here I shew you in my Bible open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before you, to do this great thing which the great God, who is my great Master▪ doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you; saying, <hi>Delight thy self also in the Lord.</hi> Mark what he saith, <hi>Thy self;</hi> he speaks to thee, in the singular, that readest, or hearest these words now, even to thee <hi>John,</hi> and thee <hi>Peter</hi> also, and to thee <hi>Mary</hi> also, and so to every one of you, according to the word <hi>also.</hi> See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you do it.</p>

So that Riches neither do nor give to any Rich man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which they promise; partly by reason of that which hath been said, and partly by reason of that which now I intend to speak, Namely, because they give no Rest, and no rest, because of these infinite cares, anxieties, and vexatious thoughts, which hang upon his spirit; so that as a clock cannot stand still from running, as long as the peazes do hang thereat, so his mind by reason of such weights, cannot repose day or night, but is forced to beat his brains, when other men take their Rest, for the compassing of those poor low things wherewith he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred.

                           <hi>did leap, and praise God for joy,</hi> Act. 39.

Shall I tell? I think they are besides themselves, as the Prodigal was; of whom it is said, that at last he came to himself, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. which sheweth, that before that he was besides himself: For if you should see one leave the daintiest dishes, which he may eat of at a sumptuous Feast, and feed on ashes, or coals, or dirt, and mans dung, like the men of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in that siege, <hi>Isa.</hi> 36.12. would ye not say, that he is mad?

                           <hi>True and solid Comfort cometh after much trouble,</hi> and may be known from false Comfort, by heaviness and broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart: For, for such <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>ordained</hi> and <hi>sent,</hi> to <hi>bind up the broken-hearted, and to appoint unto them that mourn in Sion, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness,</hi> Is. 61.3. I chuse this place, rather then such places as make mention of mourning onely, because it doth more fully set forth the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true Comfort and false; for Hypocrites may mourn too, as you have heard, when their hearts are not broken all the while; therefore I put down this brokenness of heart: and the meaning of it is this; Such as are truly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, have not onely mourned before they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:32247:131"/>were Comforted, but were so exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and grieved, as that their hearts were as it were broken, as some mens mens hearts some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are, when they are extraordinarily grieved: and this great heaviness and brokenness of heart may be known again by this; when a Vessel is broken in pieces, you know it will hold no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour, but let it all out; answerably whereunto when the heart is broken, it can no longer hold the bad liquour of sin, but sin will out, all out, and none will be left there to reign, though some unallowed dregs may remain. We have a notable place for this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>For godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> (which runs parallel with this brokenness of heart) <hi>worketh repentance unto salvation, not to be repented of;</hi> and this repentance unto salvation we know will cast out, and away every abomination, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30, 31. but now false Comfort cometh either without any sorrow, or but with a little grief; and when all is done leaves one sin or other, which like an other <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias, Mark</hi> 6.17. is not lest, nor repented of; and commonly that sin left, is either lust, or envy, or rash anger, or covetousness, or vain-glory, or stately hypocrisie, which how far it carrieth a man, I tremble to think upon; see <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11.12. So as that thereby you may know any of you, if it be your case, that though such a time ye felt much Comfort, and wept much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, yet ye were never truly comforted,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:32247:132"/>nor will be, though ye weep never so much till you leave your abominable pride, your extreme worldliness, your lasciviousness, your wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, your passionate fits, your vain, your fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, your filthy talking, and bridle your unruly tongues: I must not daub, as those which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster comfort unwarrantably unto unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and therefore I rip up these sins, and I pray God to open peoples eyes, that they may see and be convinced of them, and of the unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all their prerended comforts.</p>

O sinners! who of you should not now desire to live in this <hi>Canaan,</hi> wherein you can never want either houses, or lands, or livings, or friends, or relations, or pleasures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this hundred-fold; for if any time you lose any thing, being in this blessed <hi>Canaan,</hi> this hundred-fold wil make up all your losses, weeten all your crosses, supply all your wants, &amp; satisfie all your desires.

O my soul! do thou enter first, and being entred say to thy God, O my God, give me this fruit of this <hi>new Canaan,</hi> to eat this year and this day, I humbly pray thee; And as for you my Brethren, I hope you will
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:32247:136"/>not stay behind me, but be of the same mind with me, if not, I pray God once more to bring you in that mind, that you may eat of the fruit of this new land, this year and this day, and every day to your dying day. <hi>Amen. So be it.</hi>

                        <p>Where, by this new Wine we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, not that, which they say Christ drank with his Disciples aftes his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that
<note n="*" place="margin">Musculus in Loc.</note> heavenly joy and comfort, which in the Kingdome oH ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above, Christ; and Angels, and Saints do drink together. O sweet Wine indeed! O Wine of Wines, the sweetest that ever was tasted! Oh, when shall my soul drink of it! O when shall it once be! O souls, what should not a man be willing to do, to do so well, as to drink of this sweetest Wine, which Christ in Heaven drinketh with his Beloved? Beloved, put to it, put to it, for you may, nay, shall drink of it, if you will but now drink in those soul-saving truths, which unto you this time I have proffered, and propined: and you will say, when you shall taste the sweetness of it, sitting down with Christ in his Kingdome, and be merry with him, and drink it with him, as he saith himself, for ever and ever, that it is the sweetest Wine that ever you drank. Well, I cannot yet forget, nor forego those words of Christ, they are so exceeding sweet; For what a drinking? what a sitting? what a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:32247:137"/>feasting will that be, when the King of Kings shall sit down with his Guests? I mean, his Saints, as with his fellow Kings, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friends in his Fathers Kingdome, at his Fathers Table, and chear them up, saying, <hi>Eat, O Friends, drink, yea drink abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, O Beloved,</hi> Cant. 5.1. Nay, shall drink with them himself, and drink no other but new Wine, which is, you know, the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Wine; I mean, <hi>Such things as never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. O be even ravished with this Feast, this Sitting, this Drinking, and labour after it with all your <hi>might,</hi> that in it hereafter may be all your <hi>delight.</hi> As for the joyes which we taste in this life, in the <hi>Canaan</hi> which is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they are but an earnest-peny of this glory, but an inchoation of this beatificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a drop of that Ocean of consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof we shall take our fill in our Fathers Kingdome to an endless duration.</p>
                        <p>O eternity! O eternity of hilarity, of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity! O jucundity with which no Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian dainties, no City delights, no life of love, no love of women, or that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the love of women, can be equalled, or compared: For, think of the goodliest sight that ever could be seen, the most melodious Musick that ever could be heard, the most
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:32247:137"/>delicate Diet that ever could be tasted, the greatest Honour that can be obtained, the best Company that may be enjoyed, and all the Comforts that ever you had in this life, and in comparison of those joyes, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that Sitting down, and Drinking with Christ in it, and that cheering of Christ, and of his Friends, and the sweetness of that new Wine which I spake of, they are but a point, and less then a point, they are but petty joyes, Peacock joyes, the joyes of Prisoners, and poor Pilgrims: For what tongue can express! what minde can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend those fore-mentioned joyes of Heaven! and what it is to be amongst the Quire of Angels, to be with blessed Spirits, to be with the Father of Spirits, to be with him in his Kingdome, to be with him and with his Son, to drink with both, and to drink this new Wine of unutterable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; to be delighted with his sweetest Company, to behold his glorious face, to see that most bright and shining light, and all without any grief, without any shadow of change! O let us all change our minds therefore; and though some of us had no mind at all before now to change their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to remove from their present state, and manner of life, to go to live in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:32247:138"/>that <hi>New Land of Canaan,</hi> which I have here discovered, during their present life, and hereafter in that heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is called Eternal Life: Yet now be of an other better mind, and mind these two <hi>Canaans,</hi> so as willingly to forego all your dear things, and beloved sins for their sake, and to go to live in the one now, and in the other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after for ever.</p>
                        <p>The Lord who himself changeth not, change your minds, and he make ye a willing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon this day of his power, that by his mighty power you may be made to remove from your earthly delights and dwelling places, wherein you have hitherto mansion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, living in sin, to, and towards those heavenly mansions which are without sin, and to that lower <hi>Canaan</hi> also, which hath now been discovered to you, as flowing with milk and honey, to dwell in it with the antient of dayes all your dayes. Having thus prayed, I will try but one stroke more, and so give over: For as a great, old, sturdy Oak is not felled with one blow, but must have many; so man, who is like it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be of some standing, is not down by and by, but must have divers blowes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will fall, and fall to his work. Now
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:32247:138"/>this last stroke which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give,
<note place="margin">The final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> shall be this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conclusion, which I will fetch from that famous place, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.16. <hi>The Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were until</hi> John, <hi>since that time the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is preached, and every man pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth unto it.</hi> So it was then, and so let it be now. My Brethren, since I preached so much of a new <hi>Canaan,</hi> nay two <hi>Canaans</hi> at once, one to be entred here, and another above in Heaven; let Heaven suffer violence, as it were, among you, and let every man that heareth me, or reads these words, press into ir; or to speak a little more sutably, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the matter in hand; Let every one of you now press into both <hi>Canaans</hi> (to joyn both) into the new <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is to be had here below, actually to live in it; and into that above, by hope, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. and I also will joyn with you: And I pray God once more to help both you and me in it, that we may all get in, and may be able to say every one of us, Such a day, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the day of the Moneth, I entred both the higher <hi>Canaan</hi> and the lower; and being entred, <hi>Sate down under the shadow of Christs sweetest merits and mercy, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</hi>
